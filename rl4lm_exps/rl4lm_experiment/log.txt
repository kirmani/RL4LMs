Chief executive Mark McCafferty admitted the four-year contract extension with BT Sport will feature in talks over setting the salary cap level for the 2016-17 Aviva Premiership season. Premiership bosses confirmed the new BT deal on Monday, extending the existing four-year contract until 2021. Premiership Rugby Chief executive Mark McCafferty admits the new BT Sport deal could raise the salary cap . McCafferty accepted the salary cap could 'possibly' rise again off the back of the BT deal - but not straight away. 'We've got the salary cap levels in place for the 2015-16 season next year, and we will start discussions with the clubs over the next few months on the cap for 2016-17 onwards,' said McCafferty. 'No doubt the new BT deal gives us some certainty against which to plan those discussions.' Premiership chiefs netted £152million when agreeing their first deal with BT Sport in 2012, and this new extension is expected to command a sizeable increase. The salary cap for the Aviva Premiership will be discussed for 2016-17 onwards in the next few months . Premiership clubs continue to battle the lure of big-money moves to France in the bid to retain their top stars. Northampton skipper Dylan Hartley rejected several lucrative contract offers from French clubs to commit to Franklin's Gardens earlier this season however, and league bosses will hope increasing revenue through deals similar to the BT contract will continue to boost that ongoing fight. The Premiership's salary cap is already set to rise to £5.1million for 2015-16, with clubs able to gain £400,000 in credits for the number of home-grown players in their squad. Premiership clubs will also be able to nominate two marquee players, whose salaries are not included in the cap. McCafferty believes progressive sponsorship and commercial arrangements like the new BT deal will continue to help Premiership clubs build squads potent both at home and abroad. Dylan Hartley (centre) \xa0raises the trophy for Northampton having won the 2014 Aviva Premiership . English and French clubs spent two years haggling over reform of the European rugby competitions, securing meritocratic qualification and record broadcasting investment in the process. For the first time since 1998, four English clubs have qualified for the quarter-finals of Europe's top club contest, in the inaugural European Champions Cup. 'We're particularly keen on all of the talent that we've been developing through the academies: those players have been breaking through into the England set-up at a younger age,' said McCafferty. 'We've got a good, strong, young English squad, and we've had strong performances in Europe from our top clubs.

2023-01-26 13:18:40,733 [INFO] {'split_name': 'val', 'sample_id': 'val_10971', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: Utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when the governor signed a law on Monday approving the method when no lethal injection drugs were available, even though he called it 'a little bit gruesome'. Utah is a capital punishment state and needs a backup execution method in case a shortage of the drugs persists,\xa0Republican Governor Gary Herbert said. 'We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty, and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued,' the governor's spokesman said. Scroll down for video . The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah in June 2010.\xa0Utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when Governor Gary Herbert signed a law Monday approving the method for use when no lethal injection drugs are available . However, enforcing death sentences is 'the obligation of the executive branch'. The governor's office noted that other states allow execution methods other than lethal injection. In Washington state, inmates can request hanging. In New Hampshire, hangings are fallback if lethal injections can't be given. Ronnie Lee Gardner, pictured above, was the last person killed by firing squad in the U.S. after choosing this method of execution. Gardner, 49, was executed on June 18, 2010, at 12.15am at Utah State Prison in Draper. In 1984, Gardner had killed Melvyn John Otterstrom, shooting him in the face during a robbery in Salt Lake City and leaving his body to be found by his wife. In April 1985, he shot dead attorney Michael Burdell at a court hearing as he tried to escape. He was given a life sentence for the first murder and condemned to die for the second. The firing squad was made up of police officers who had volunteered. One gun was loaded with non-lethal wax bullets so it would not be known who fired the kill shot. And an Oklahoma law would allow the state to use firing squads if lethal injections are ever declared unconstitutional. Utah's new approval of firing squads carries no such legal caveat and represents the latest example of frustration over botched executions and the difficulty of obtaining lethal injection drugs as manufacturers opposed to capital punishment have made them off-limits to prisons. Death by firing squad requires detailed preparations. The prisoner is strapped into a chair at the ankles and by the arms and chest in front of a wood panel with sandbags piled high on either side to prevent the bullets ricocheting. A target is pinned to the prisoner's heart with the intention that shots be fired into the heart rather than the head and the individual will bleed out quickly. The shooters are picked from volunteer police officers. The inmate has two minutes to say any final words before five shooters line up behind a slot in the wall, 25 feet from the chair. The shots are fired from .30 caliber Winchester rifles until the prisoner is declared dead. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield, argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more decent than the drawn-out deaths involved when lethal injections go awry - or even if they go as planned. Though Utah's next execution is probably a few years away, Ray said wants to settle on a backup method now so authorities are not racing to find a solution if the drug shortage drags on. Ray didn't return messages seeking comment Monday. Opponents of the measure say firing squads are barbaric, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah saying the bill makes the state 'look backward and backwoods.' Utah lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004, saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention away from victims. The last person executed by firing squad was Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. He was executed on the metal chair at the right side of this chamber in Utah State Prison. \xa0Narrow rifle ports can be seen on the left . Utah is the only state in the past 40 years to carry out such a death sentence, with three executions by firing squad since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The last was in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was put to death by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in an event that generated international interest and elicited condemnation from many. Gardner killed a bartender and later shot a lawyer to death and wounded a bailiff during a 1985 courthouse escape attempt. The bailiff's widow, VelDean Kirk, who witnessed Gardner's execution, said she supports the new law. 'I don't think it's barbaric,' she said. 'I think that's the best way to do it.' Gardner's brother recently has spoken out against the method. Randy Gardner of Salt Lake City said Monday that he doesn't condone his brother's actions, but he opposes the death penalty and said firing squads make the state look bad. 'My god, we're the only ones that are shooting people in the heart,' he said. One person nearing a possible execution date is Ron Lafferty, the state's longest-serving death row inmate, who claimed God directed him to kill his sister-in-law and her baby daughter in 1984 because of the victim's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy. Lafferty has already requested the firing squad — an option available to him even before this new law was passed because he, like Gardner, was convicted prior to 2004, when lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad. The other Utah death row inmate who could be next up for execution, Doug Carter, has chosen lethal injection. Under this new law, Carter would get the firing squad if the state can't get their hands on lethal injection drugs 30 days before. The state doesn't currently have lethal injection drugs on hand.

Queen Letizia of Spain (right) and Colombian president's wife Maria Clemencia Rodriguez (left) followed their husbands during the official ceremony welcoming the South American leaders to Madrid . The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels. Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch. As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting. Her South American counterpart, Maria Clemencia Rodriguez went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket.

From left to right, Queen Letizia of Spain, Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, King Felipe VI of Spain and Maria Clemencia Rodriguez, the first lady of Colombia on the steps of La Zarzuela palace . The women walked behind their husbands and seemed to have plenty to talk during the stately event which was then followed by an official luncheon at La Zarzuela Palace. The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper. Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

She's a royal who's garnered a firm fashion following and with outfits like this, it's easy to see why Queen Letizia's style goes down such a storm. We love the way she's introduced a slight edginess to her look thanks to the studded dress which puts a fresh spin on the otherwise classic colour block design. Her chic frock is by one of her favourite designers, Felipe Varela, who's designs she often turns to for public appearances. That said, we love the fact she also champions the Spanish high-street by regularly wearing brands like Zara, Uterque and Mango. Love Letizia's dress too?

At the event, which will run until 1 March, Letizia gazed at one piece made up of a vast canvas covered in red paint, nailed to the wall, which appeared to drip into a red pool on the floor where lay clustered a paint roller, pots and brushes.

Jose Mourinho's men saw their 2-0 lead wiped out by Steve Bruce's side, but Loic Remy's winner moved the Blues six points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand. Here's how Sportsmail's NEIL ASHTON rated the players at the KC Stadium: . Loic Remy came off the bench to score the winner for Chelsea in their victory at Hull . HULL CITY . ALLAN McGREGOR - 5.5 . The Hull goalkeeper had little chance with Chelsea's goals. MICHAEL DAWSON - 6.5 . He had a jittery opening but improved after the change in formation. Hull City defender Michael Dawson tries to charge down a shot from Diego Costa . ALEX BRUCE - 6 . Once he got to grips with Diego Costa he got better. PAUL McSHANE - 6.5 . An early switch to right back spared him. AHMED ELMOHAMADY - 7.5 . Scored a very nice goal and is one of the Premier League’s biggest secrets. Ahmed Elmohamady scores Hull's first goal in the 26th minute to bring them back into the game . GASTON RAMIREZ - 6.5 . The 24-year-old Uruguayan was diligent and energetic before he was eventually substituted. JAKE LIVERMORE - 6 . He seemed to be taken by surprise with pace of game but eventually improved. DAVID MEYLER - 6 . Always put his body on the line. A decent enough performance. Hull City midfielder David Meyler challenges Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic . ANDY ROBERTSON - 6.5 . He made a good run down the left for Elmohamady's goal. DAME N’DOYE - 6.5 . Provided a threat to the Chelsea defence, particularly in first half. ABEL HERNANDEZ - 7 . The 24-year-old striker was denied by Thibaut Courtois once, but not twice. Abel Hernandez celebrates after scoring Hull's equaliser at the KC Stadium . SUBSTITUTES -\xa0Stephen Quinn - 6 (Meyler 80): Hull were stretched to limit by time he came on. Sone Aluko - 6\xa0(Robertson 81): Tough for him to get a chance once Chelsea tightened up. Robbie Brady -6 (Ramirez 80):\xa0Came on as a last throw of the dice. NOT USED: Stephen Harper, Liam Rosenior, Curtis Davies, Yannick Sagbo. MANAGER - STEVE BRUCE: 6.5 - A tactical switch at 2-0 down brought Hull back in to it. CHELSEA . THIBAUT COURTOIS - 6.5 . The Belgian thought he was 'sweeper keeper' Manuel Neuer for Hernandez's equaliser - he isn’t. A triple save spared Chelsea. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois rises high to claim the ball as Dawson tries to win a header for Hull . BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - 6.5 . An awful backpass that led to Hernandez's goal, but the Serbian was better in the second half. GARY CAHILL - 6.5 . A sky high punt towards end of first half said it all, but he was much more composed in the second half. JOHN TERRY - 6.5 . The Chelsea captain lost composure and his usual excellent organisation in a mad five minutes. Chelsea captain John Terry celebrates a victory that moved his team a step closer to winning the league . FILIPE LUIS - 6 . The Brazilian full-back was terrorised throughout by Elmohamady. RAMIRES - 5 . He was awful and substituted. Bring back the old Ramires. Ramires, pictured being tackled by Andrew Robertson, had a day to forget and was substituted . NEMANJA MATIC - 5 . He used to boss the midfield, but is \xa0now being bossed. WILLIAN - 6 . He made a couple of decent touches and put in some hard work, but seriously, is that it? CESC FABREGAS - 7 . Credit to this guy because he never stops running and was hugely influential in the second half. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas tires to win a header against Hull's Meyler . EDEN HAZARD - 7.5 . A magnificent strike after less than two minutes to give Chelsea the lead. DIEGO COSTA - 6.5 . A sweet strike to put Chelsea 2-0 up before he was substituted with a leg injury. Diego Costa was on the score sheet before he was forced off injured in the second half . SUBSTITUTES: Oscar - 6 (Ramires 61): A change that had to happen, although Oscar is out of touch too. Loic Remy - 7.5 (Costa 75): What an impact, he scored with his first touch. Remy came off the bench to score past Allan McGregor in the 77th minute to secure a Chelsea win . Kurt Zouma - 6.5\xa0(Willian 80) Defensive substitution to tighten it up. NOT USED: Petr Cech, Juan Cuadrado, Cesar Azpilucueta, Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

Fifty-seven per cent of those aged 18 to 34, in LA spoke a language other than English at home, beating out Miami which had 55 per cent and San Jose with 54 per cent. Roughly a quarter of the 'Millenial' generation nationwide uses another language, according to the American Community Survey. A map of young adults' ability to speak a language other than English uses dark red for counties where more than 40 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds communicate in a foreign language at home, and lighter shades of pink for smaller proportions of the population . Roughly 60 per cent of LA city residents age five and older speak a language other than English, with Spanish the most popular language among them. In addition to a large number of Latino immigrants, Los Angeles also has large Middle Eastern, Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European communities. However, the proportion of foreign-born adults in Los Angeles has actually decreased 9 percentage points to a little less than a third since 1990, and a large number of the Millenials with foreign language skills are thought to be bilingual. The rise in bilingualism is probably caused by children continuing to speak their parents' tongues in addition to English, according to\xa0Voice of America. UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa said that the children and grandchildren of immigrants historically stopped learning to speak the same language of their ancestors, but that there has been a 'sea change in the last ten years'. California has seen a growing percentage of its young adults speaking foreign languages (bars in blue) since the 1980s. The US as a whole (pink bars) has also seen its rate increase at a slower pace . Hinojosa said that languages beyond Spanish, second and third-generation immigrants will be encouraged to keep knowledge of Mandarin and other languages. The American Community Survey collected data between 2009 and 2013 and found that 23.3 per cent of the population was between 18 and 34 years old, a fall from 30 per cent in 1980. Data showed that the generation is less likely to be married and more likely to have gone to college than three decades ago, as well as more likely to speak a foreign language. Areas that showed the highest rates for speaking something other than English were near the US-Mexico border in California and Texas. New Jersey was found to be the third most likely state for a young adult to speak a foreign language at home. West Virginia ranked last for the statistic with 3.63 per cent and Middlesborough, Kentucky, was the metro with the lowest percentage of young adults who could speak a foreign language with 0.034. In contrast to Los Angeles, many US cities and states have seen significant increases in their foreign-born populations. The United States as a whole saw its estimated foreign-born population decline 0.4 percentage points from 2000 to the American Community Survey. US: 25 per cent . Atlanta: 22.5 . Boston: 28.1 .

2023-01-26 13:18:40,799 [INFO] {'split_name': 'val', 'sample_id': 'val_2601', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: When Oscar Garcia quit as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv last summer he cited the prospect of Islamic militant rockets flying over the club training ground as a reason to leave. As reasons go, it’s as good as it gets. The man that succeeded him though, was undeterred. Indeed, former Liverpool coach Pako Ayestaran has never been afraid of taking bold steps. At Valencia, when trusted assistant to Rafa Benitez, he was the man who encouraged Benitez to move to Liverpool when the opportunity arose. ‘I was a Liverpool fan,’ says Ayestaran. ‘As a boy I had seen their team in 1975, with Toshack and Keegan, beat Real Sociedad 9-1 and it stuck with me. When I heard Rafa had the chance to go, I said he had to take it.’ Pako Ayestaran (right) alongside Rafael Benitez during their time at Liverpool . Ayestaran was assistant manager under Benitez at Valencia and Liverpool . Equally, when he felt Benitez had lost sight of what made their partnership so good, Ayestaran left Liverpool. Their friendship was fractured and never repaired but Ayestaran used those early principles to forge his own management career. When Maccabi sports director Jordi Cruyff called about moving to Tel Aviv, Ayestaran sensed an opportunity; not one of danger and trepidation but a challenge he could relish. ‘It is similar to when I was a young man in the 70s and 80s in the Basque country in Spain,’ says Ayestaran. ‘I was living with the threat of ETA, the Basque separatists, and bombs every day. People would call and ask ‘’are you ok there?’’ And you’d say ‘’yes I’m off to the park’’ or ‘’I’m having a cup of coffee’’. In my mind, life was normal. Ayestaran takes training at\xa0Maccabi Tel Aviv . ‘Tel Aviv is different to the north of Israel. If conflict starts it is normally on the West Bank or Jerusalem but not so much here. ‘It has been peaceful since the ceasefire was agreed in August. I can lead a normal life here. As normal as in London or Paris. The quality of life here is amazing. I will take my son to play tennis later and on Thursday I am going to the opera.’ Today, Ayestaran is eating lunch at a bistro on the Tel Aviv promenade. He looks trim, sharply dressed and sunglasses protect him from the glare of bright sunshine as the Mediterranean Sea laps over the busy beach. He has embraced Cruyff’s challenge. Maccabi have won one trophy, the Toto Cup, and a 2-1 victory over Maccabi Haifa on Monday means they are still on course for a domestic treble for the first time in their 109 year history. It is clear the methods Ayestaran practised at Anfield and since with last club Tecos in Mexico are having an effect. ‘One thing I learned is that you have to listen to your staff,’ Ayestaran says pointedly. He succeeded former boss Oscar Garcia as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel . Ayestaran (third left) was part of the Liverpool set up that helped them to Champions League victory in 2005 . ‘You may have your own ideas and make a different decision but the people around you are there for a reason and it’s important you account for that in your management and coaching. ‘Expectation is high here because of the club’s history but I’m not afraid of that. You have to take responsibility. It’s the evolution of a team, increasing the levels. I set a target of winning the treble early on and that brings pressure but that’s a pressure I’m happy with. 'The Israeli people are passionate about their football and it’s a release in many ways from what else goes on in life here.’ Football remains Israel’s most popular sport along with basketball and swimming. Israel top their group in the European Championship qualifiers and host Wales on Saturday. Maccabi have four players in the squad, one, attacking midfielder Eran Zehavi, has been the subject of interest from Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund while Crystal Palace tried to sign him in January. He has scored 31 goals this season already. Maccabi Tel Aviv manager Ayestaran giving orders to his team . ‘It’s a gift for Maccabi to have him at the club,’ says Ayestaran. ‘A player with the right character to take this club one step forward. He could certainly succeed in the Premier League.’ The 52-year-old Ayestaran retains a strong interest in English football where he is also drawing attention from clubs looking at foreign coaches. He has kept his house, a stone’s throw away from the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Wirral, and is still in contact with the likes of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. They met up for lunch on a recent trip back to the UK. ‘We had a glass of wine and talked about football,’ says Ayestaran. ‘They are great characters. Jamie is like a sponge for information, he soaks up everything. I can remember at Liverpool when he was in the treatment room and he was having a debate about who played right-back in the 1974 FA Cup final. 'He approaches everything with such passion. I can see him coaching one day. Steven is also so passionate about the game and the project he is taking on in Los Angeles. When I arrived at Liverpool I think they were both a little unsure; they’d give their opinions but they listened and had respect for what we wanted to do. 'It made them think more about what they were doing as players and they are great students of the game. Their personalities are strong and they helped coaches to set the standard at Liverpool. For them the club came first.’ Ayestaran has backed his friend and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher to move into coaching . The former Liverpool assistant is also still in contact with Reds captain Steven Gerrard . While his bond with many of the friends he made in Liverpool is intact, Ayestaran admits regret that his relationship with Benitez remains broken. The pair won promotion at Tenerife, two Spanish titles with Valencia and the Champions League at Liverpool. ‘It’s sad that we haven’t spoken. We had a lot of very good moments and it’s better to remember those than the bad, life is too short.’ Ayestaran though is making confident strides as the main man. After Benitez, he took time out to learn from coaches such as Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola, had a short spell as director of football at Real Sociedad and spent time with Porto. ‘I’ve found it a natural transition,’ he says. ‘I needed my own project. It’s important that clubs have a model like Porto where even if change in personnel comes, and sometimes frequently, the model, the belief remains.’ And could he see himself in England again soon? ‘It’s the place I enjoy the most and my sons still consider England home. I would love that one day but for now my focus is Maccabi Tel Aviv - then maybe England can be my next chapter.’", 'generated_text': "moved to Tel Aviv just one day after losing sight of their partnership. former manager had shared his passion for football with defender Rafa Benitez. he was a young man who played for the club at a'shack' level.", 'ref_text': "<START-1>Pako Ayesteran took over from  Oscar Garcia at Maccabi Tel Aviv .\nOn course for domestic treble for first time in the club's history .\nUsed to be assistant at Valencia and Liverpool under Rafa Benitez .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8320125937461853, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}

After not starting in the Barclays Premier League until the Boxing Day win over QPR, the Czech playmaker has now chalked up some 23 appearances overall as Arsenal moved back into the top four and also booked a place in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley. Rosicky, 34, has not ruled out extending his stay at the Emirates Stadium club, which has been hampered by an unfortunate series of injuries. Tomas Rosicky has revealed he considered leaving Arsenal in January following a lack of first-team football . 'Since the start of the year things have improved, the team has started to play better football and what's more I'm playing. Compared to the first six months, it's much better. We'll see how it goes from here,' Rosicky said to Czech press, quoted by www.isport.blesk.cz. 'I don't really know [why I didn't play]. It's a good question, I would also like to know. 'The coach gave me a chance towards the end the year and then began to give me more playing time. I don't know, maybe it was a watershed moment.' Rosicky, seen with Olivier Giroud, \xa0hopes to play a full part in the Gunners' end-of-season run-in . Rosicky added: 'We had talked about [me leaving in January] in previous meetings back in September and October, but then the market closed and I couldn't do anything. 'When you don't play a single game in December and the market opens, [the prospect of leaving] is obviously on the agenda. Then you start to have second thoughts. 'It was an exception for me though, I really thought about it. Then Arsenal said stay and that was that. Rosicky, 34, has not ruled out extending his stay at the Emirates Stadium come the end of the season . 'The rest of the season will go quickly, then we'll look for a solution. 'Arsenal is still an option for me next season, the ball is in their court. When I get back from international duty we will start to talk about it. 'There are two options open to me [stay at Arsenal or go elsewhere]. At the moment I am in a situation where I make the decision.'

2023-01-26 13:26:36,057 [INFO] {'split_name': 'test', 'sample_id': 'test_9182', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings\xa0A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured),\xa0Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC\xa0last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'", 'generated_text': "'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the crash in the Alps. a common theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected financial Times. the crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. investigators say he locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet. authorities also point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer", 'ref_text': "<START-1>'Electronic hacking' could have caused the air disaster, aviation boss says .\nGermanwings tragedy has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz .\nBut Matt Andersson says investigators have yet to come to a final conclusion .\nSays passenger planes do not have same level of protection as military jets .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8730490803718567, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}

This was a game they could not afford to lose. Not when their final seven games include fixtures against Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But lose they did, bringing their winless run to five and leaving themselves in a right mess. Bafetimbi Gomis roars with celebration after giving Swansea a 2-0 lead against Hull at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Gomis unleashed a thunderous overhead kick shortly before half-time to capitalise on some poor Hull defending . The French striker fires a spectacular volley past Allan McGregor and into the roof of the Hull net to double the home side's lead . The Swansea striker celebrates his strike in front of a group of young supporters after doubling his side's lead in the first half .

Bafetimbi Gomis scored a spectacular overhead. CLICK HERE for more match zone . True, they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – Bafetimbi Gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and David Meyler’s second-half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match. They managed no shots on goal in the time it took Swansea to go 2-0 ahead through Ki Sung-Yueng and Gomis’s bicycle kick. And it was only in the second half that they mounted a challenge. As fate would have it, Meyler was sent off for fouling Kyle Naughton two minutes after Paul McShane had given Hull a lifeline. Gomis finished them in stoppage time. Bruce was exasperated. He said: ‘We were disappointed to lose the game and we knew we were nowhere near good enough in the first-half in particular. ‘But the two big decisions went against us and they could have turned the game. Gomis’ first goal is a fantastic piece of skill but he is five yards offside. Gomis grabbed his second of the match after racing on to Jonjo Shelvey's pass and chipping McGregor in injury time . The 29-year-old celebrates in front of the Swansea fans on his hands and knees after making sure of the three points . Paul McShane pulled a goal back for Hull five minutes into the second half when he pounced in the six-yard box . The Hull defender slotted past\xa0Lukasz Fabianski from just four yard out after latching onto a free kick totally unmarked . ‘We had got back into the game at 2-1 but unfortunately David has picked up a red card. I’ve seen it six times now and from three angles and to me it’s a perfectly decent challenge. ‘The other three I look at it and he takes part of the ball and the leg collides with the boy. We may as well say with these grey areas that you are not allowed to tackle if you tackle on the floor.’ The consequence of the challenge, beyond damage to Hull’s survival prospects, is that Naughton went to hospital for an X-ray on his ankle. Garry Monk said: ‘His ankle is really swollen. That is the real negative. We hope it is not serious. At the time I thought it was a genuine 50-50 challenge. My initial reaction was “bad challenge” but I don’t think there was any malice. You run that risk if your foot is high and goes over the ball.’ For Monk, it was the only complaint from a match that Swansea probably could have won in third gear. That’s no exaggeration in the context of how poor Hull were in the opening 45 minutes. For a team in that kind of mess, with those fixtures still to come, it was incomprehensible. That’s not to say Swansea stormed from the blocks. Ki’s opener after 18 minutes was actually the first chance of the game. Jonjo Shelvey had taken his usual punt from distance and while Allan McGregor did well to get down and save, his parry fell squarely at the feet of the South Korean. David Meyler was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after McShane pulled a goal back for a lunge on Kyle Naughton . Hull midfielder Meyler and his team-mates look on in disbelief as Andre Mariner reaches for the red card . Swansea right back Naughton limps from the field and has to be replaced by Angel Rangel following Meyler's tackle . Ki buried the finish without taking a touch and now has scored four goals in eight games. With seven this season, the deep-lying midfielder has become a delightfully complete player. It took 24 minutes for Hull to have their first chance – Abel Hernandez hit a bouncing ball from 30 yards and it trickled all the way to Lukasz Fabianski. It wasn’t even on target. The rest of their attacks fizzled, a side with five across the middle seemingly incapable of holding possession. Gomis nailed the second with a goal that was hardly at home in such a subdued game. It really was a beautiful finish. Kyle Naughton delivered a ball into the area, Michael Dawson attempted to head clear and the striker buried a bicycle kick. Replays showed he had come back from an offside position, but the finish was magnificent. At that stage, Hull appeared out of it. Monk warned his side of complacency at the break and, in his words, ‘they did the total opposite’. It enabled Hull to pull one back after 49 minutes. Ashley Williams had tangled with Dame N’Doye and conceded a free-kick which Robbie Brady delivered from the right. Alex Bruce found space from six yards to flick a header at goal and McShane poked a finish past Fabianski. For two minutes Hull looked a genuine threat. And then, just as quickly, hope was gone. Meyler went high on Naughton and will miss the next three games. Ki Sung-Yueng opened the scoring for the home side inside 20 minutes after pouncing following an Allan McGregor save . Ki leads the celebrations after giving Garry Monk's side an early advantage at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Hull, to their credit, did not give up. But it was in their desperation for a leveller that they conceded a third. Nathan Dyer dispossessed Brady and Sigurdsson sent a long ball to Gomis. With none of Hull’s outfield players in their own half, the Frenchman had time to think before a nice chip over McGregor. In this strange old season of moans and a feint, he has also made his way to eight goals in all competitions. It will be interesting to see if his improved recent form has soothed some of the anger caused by his January agitations. It will be more interesting in the shorter term to see if Hull can find the significant improvement needed to get themselves out of this hole.", 'generated_text': "Bafetimbi Gomis gave the home side a 2-0 lead against Hull at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday. the french striker doubled the home side's lead in the first half. the home side won 2-0 from the break and did not lose the premier league.", 'ref_text': "<START-1>Swansea City beat Hull City 2-1 in the Premier League at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday .\nKi Sung-Yueng fired the hosts into the lead after 18 minutes when he turned home Jonjo Shelvey's parried effort .\nBafetimbi Gomis doubled the lead when he fired a volley into the roof of the net eight minutes before half-time .\nPaul McShane got a goal back for the visitors just five\xa0minutes\xa0after the restart, tapping in from close range .\nDavid Meyley was given a straight red card three minutes after the goal when he lunged in on Kyle Naughton .\nGomis made it 3-1 in injury time to grab his second of the match and restore the host's two-goal advantage .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8529582619667053, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}
2023-01-26 13:26:36,091 [INFO] {'split_name': 'test', 'sample_id': 'test_2441', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: Hibs, Hearts and Rangers united in condemnation of the SPFL's decision to move the Ibrox club's final game of the Championship season back 24 hours. In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 — 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes . Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the 'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3 . 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change . 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well. Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time. It would be only right.'", 'generated_text': ", Hearts and Rangers are angry over the decision to move back 24 hours. the'sporting integrity' of the final game of the season has been pushed back. the move is designed to accommodate broadcasters. the'sporting integrity' of Rangers being played 24 hours after rivals.

Food pairing menus are all the rage these days, with beers, wines and even coffees all getting the matching makeover from experts. But one US restaurant has taken things a step further by matching their mains to marijuana. Bright spark: The Amsterdam Falafel Shop in Washington DC, US, is the first restaurant in the country with a menu that matches cannabis to food . Canny move: The restaurant's menu pairs five falafels to five strains of marijuana . Amsterdam Falafel Shop in Washington DC, US, has launched its pot-pairing menu which matches five falafels to different strains of weed. This is strictly a take-away operation though, as those who like to indulge won't be able to smoke on the premises. Owners Arianne and Scott Bennett devised the rather sophisticated  falafel toppings best eaten when smoking different strains of marijuana. For those who like to imbibe in some OG Kush, the restaurant recommends a falafel sandwich of baba ganoush, beetroot, pickled turnips, coleslaw, garlic parsley and tahini. If it's an Afghani strain that's got you excited, then opt for sliced cucumber, onion and dill salad, fried aubergines, and thinly layered garlic cream. According to the menu, this is the best combo for that particular strain as the 'pot/sandwich pairing has been known to induce intense relaxation.' The falafel topping counter at the restaurant includes julienne vegetables, salads and various dips . If you're looking for more of an energetic experience, the menu advises to pair a baba ganoush and chickpea, pickle, tomato, cucumber, tahini and red pepper sauce salad with a Cactus joint. 'This pairing has been known to induce an uplifting, energizing and euphoric effect,' the menu states. Sparking up Lemon Haze? Go for a hummus, yoghurt sauce, garlic parsley, crunchy onion, pickled cauliflower and Turkish salad combo; a pairing which will give you 'energy and creativity.' It's pairing different weed with different types of food,' Mr Bennett said to Fox News . 'You're tasting different things. I mean, different weed taste differently.'

Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . A further sign of the Highlanders’ fortitude came with the way in which they absorbed the loss of goalkeeper Dean Brill to a nasty knee injury but, in truth, neither side was able to play their favoured passing game thanks to the combination of a bobbly pitch and a strong wind. Celtic last travelled here during their troubled and ultimately unsuccessful bid to qualify for the Champions League group stages, with manager Ronny Deila making 10 changes to the team in the midst of a two-legged tie with Slovenian champions Maribor. Names like (Filip) Twardzik, (Teemu) Pukki and (Dylan) McGeouch featured on the team-sheet that day, with teenage Irish defender Eoghan O’Connell having the dubious honour of match-winner, his own goal gifting Inverness Caley their 1-0 victory. With Celtic eager to wrap up the title as quickly as possible, a victory was the priority this time and there were three changes to the team that beat Partick Thistle in midweek, Efe Ambrose and Scott Brown joining Griffiths in the starting line-up. Deila has taken to rotating his strikers of late and Griffiths immediately staked his claim with a clinical piece of forward play which had shades of the sort of goal he regularly scored for Hibs en route to picking up the Player of the Year title with the Easter Road club a couple of years ago. Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring . Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic . Brown, restored to the team after suspension — and booked again on Saturday — offered assistance by launching a long pass into the wind. The stiff breeze coming off the Moray Firth was enough to give Griffiths the chance to beat Gary Warren in a race for the ball. By the time the defender had got square, Griffiths had worked the ball onto his left foot and drilled an emphatic finish into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards. With their team on such a poor run and struggling to score goals, the locals cringed — but Inverness rallied and produced an impressive response. Ofere may have shown little to suggest he can offset the loss of McKay’s goals but he is a powerful specimen and this, clearly, was his type of occasion. Before scoring, he had already given Jason Denayer a couple of bumps and he was there to punish the Belgian for the goal. Denayer did all he could to prevent the ball crossing the line when he blocked Ryan Christie’s net-bound effort but Ofere was there to jab home the finish from close range. Few teams have the physicality to match Celtic but Ofere typifies the muscular streak that runs through Hughes’ team, with Warren, Josh Meekings, Warren, Greg Tansey and Ross Draper all quite happy to mix it with the champions. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . In such circumstances, Celtic turn to Brown, and the captain stepped up to the plate, breaking up play and showing a willingness to carry the ball forward from deep. He was the most impressive performer afield, yet his game was not without controversy as he picked up a yellow card for tumbling when tackled by David Raven, a harsh sanction from referee Craig Thomson, who adjudged the contact insufficient to award a penalty. The Highland team had to overcome a more serious setback, however, when goalkeeper Brill went down in obvious discomfort after kicking clear as Gary Mackay-Steven moved in. There seemed no ill-intent in the Celtic winger’s challenge but Brill required five minutes of treatment before being stretchered off and replaced by Ryan Esson. To his credit, the substitute produced impressive saves either side of half-time to tip over headers from Ambrose and Denayer. Caley dropped deeper as the game wore on, with Deila introducing Kris Commons, Adam Matthews and John Guidetti in a bid to force the issue. Even so, it was Inverness who came on strongly at the end. Raven and Tansey flashed shots over, although ultimately there was nothing to test the capabilities of Craig Gordon in goal.", 'generated_text': 'lead came the second set with a two-minute header.

The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin. 'He got up and resumed teaching after the demo was over.

But the 43-year-old is now calling on fellow consumers to pay more attention to what goes into their meals and garments - by thinking about that final product came from. Stella McCartney attends an event to honour Kate Moss last April. The designer is calling on consumers to be more aware of where their food and fashion comes from . In a new interview with The Business Of Fashion (BoF) magazine, she said: 'The consumption of animals - whether you're wearing them or eating them - is extraordinarily damaging to the planet. 'There are over a billion animals killed a year for food, half of which don't even get eaten. And there's over 50 million animals killed just for fashion.' 'If you're mindful of how you're approaching your life, then you see the connection. You can't avoid the connection. 'The connection between food, illness, environment. I want to see everything as a whole, so that's how I approach life, and that's how it comes into my business.' At the start of her fashion career, many criticised Stella - who helped kick off the vegetarian movement Meat Free Mondays with her father - for her refusal to produce and clothes with leather, fur or feathers. But while the mother-of-four is something of a pioneer in ethical high fashion, she concedes that finding high-quality substitutes is a challenge. Stella and her father Paul following the\xa0Stella McCartney Green Carpet Collection during London Fashion Week in September 2014 . ‘Material is hard,' she said: . ‘Clearly leather is a great material. It wears well. It moves. You can wash it. It’s real. One of the hardest things is to design something that is desirable and then to take that design and make it in a way that is not conventional. 'We’re sourcing our own material, developing our own material - we’re not using PVC.’ And, ahead of a lecture she is holding with the magazine tonight in London, Stella said she even feels the need to apologise to her designers  for the limitations of using non-leather alternatives.

A court ruling over a Christian bakery which refused to make a pro-gay marriage cake could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it has been claimed. Colin and Karen McArthur, owners of Ashers Baking Company, in Northern Ireland, are facing a discrimination claim after they refused to bake a cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie under the slogan 'support gay marriage.' But now a leading lawyer has warned that if the case is successful it could set a dangerous legal precedent and undermine freedom of conscience. Aidan O'Neill QC said the case could mean atheist web designers being forced to build a website saying God created the world in six days, or lesbian t-shirt makers being compelled to print shirts saying gay marriage is an 'abomination'. Mr O'Neill posed the hypothetical scenarios in a legal opinion penned ahead of a hearing at Belfast County Court later this month. The case began in May last year after LGBT activist Gareth Lee placed an order for a novelty cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie. The design called for the puppets, who are often likened to a gay married couple, arm in arm under the slogan 'support gay marriage'. While the bakery initially took the order and a deposit, Mr Lee was later told they would be unable to comply on religious grounds, and he was refunded his money. Aidan O'Neill QC, a prominent human rights lawyer, has said the case could set a dangerous precedent that could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce Mohammed cartoons (pictured, the cake design) Despite being able to find another baker who completed his request on time and at no extra cost, Mr Lee argues that he has been discriminated against. He is now seeking £500 in damages in a case which has the backing of\xa0the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Mr O'Neill has published his legal opinion ahead of the hearing, saying that Mr and Mrs McArthur are 'committed Christians', and that their beliefs should also be protected by discrimination laws. He argues that, by being forced to make the cake the couple would be forced to promote a view they do not hold, which goes against their right to freedom of expression. Mr O'Neill argues that Mr and Mrs\xa0McArthur are 'committed Christians' and that their right to freedom of expression is also protected under human rights laws (pictured, the couple's bakery) He added: 'This freedom not to be forced or required to express support for a particular opinion or political position was, indeed, the very one which Sir Thomas More strove to uphold in declining to sign the Act of Supremacy declaring Henry VIII to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England.' Colin Hart, director of the Christian Institute which commissioned Mr O'Neill, said: 'The strength and clarity of the advice from Mr O’Neill, who has a national reputation for his human rights expertise, should set off the alarm bells in this Government quango. 'It spells out the very real dangers and far-reaching implications for freedom of speech, but the equality watchdog seems determined to force people to use their creative skills to promote a political cause they fundamentally disagree with. 'This family run bakers serve gay customers all the time but they didn’t want to promote gay marriage.'", 'generated_text': 'Colin and Karen McArthur are facing a £500 damages claim. claim could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce cartoons. experts warn case could threaten freedom of conscience. the case could lead to discrimination laws and undermine freedom of conscience.', 'ref_text': "<START-1>Christian bakers being taken to court after refusing to make 'gay cake'\nDesign showed Bert and Ernie puppets with slogan 'support gay marriage'\nGareth Lee, who placed order, claims he was discriminated against .\nBut top lawyer has warned that case could set dangerous legal precedent .\nSaid Muslim printers could be forced into reproducing Mohammed images .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8522080183029175, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}

But the expected price tag on one of Apple's new Watches is far from wallet-friendly. At $10,000, the 18-carat gold, sapphire and crystal Apple Watch Edition being launched on Monday would be the firm's most expensive product since the $10,000 Lisa computer in 1983, developed by Steve Jobs, which was poorly received. It is the first new innovation to come from Apple since Jobs died in 2011, and will be unveiled by chief executive Tim Cook on Monday. Analysts have branded the move a clear attempt to segway into Asia's booming luxury goods market - and suggest it could be the start of an entirely new market. Scroll down for video . Luxury: The  Apple Watch Edition is 18-carat gold, sapphire and crystal, priced at a reported $10,000 . 'Elegant curve': A luxury goods analyst for Sotheby's said the design looks promising as a high-end product . Launch: Tim Cook will unveil the new Apple Watch Edition, plus two others, on Monday . 'Apple is the only technology brand that has the potential to move from tech brand to luxury brand. This is unprecedented,' Jan Dawson, chief technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, told DailyMail.com. 'I think this is Apple flexing its muscles, moving into a space that it potentially has all to itself. 'The question is: how big is that market? Is Apple eating into the market or making it bigger? 'I think they will make it grow.' Cook is expected to explain in detail how customers will use the buttons on the side of the device to operate the apps on the screen like an iPhone. At the other end of the spectrum, customers can opt for a midrange watch or an 'entry-level' Watch Sport, starting at $349 - a fraction of most watch prices on the market. Tag Heuer's Monaco Men's Watch will set shoppers back $72,000. The Rolex GMT-Master II Mens Automatic Watch costs an eye-watering $373,720. The move into this market comes months after Apple poached Burberry's CEO Angela Ahrendts to be the new Senior Vice President of retail and sales - and lend a fashionable eye. Alongside Yves Saint Laurent's Paul Deneve, as a 'special projects' Vice President, and designer Marc Newson, as a part-time consultant, the team has masterminded the firm's unprecedented move. Big move: The products will be the first new innovations to come from Apple since Steve Jobs died in 2011 . Wearables: Analysts say the shift into wearables will be a major breakthrough for the firm targeting China . In October, a prototype of the Edition Watch even appeared at Paris Fashion Week. However, some have speculated that without a solid grounding in the high-end retail market, the Apple Edition Watch could suffer the same flaws as most iPhones, which cease to efficiently function after a few years. But according to Thomaï Serdari, Luxury Brand Strategist and Lecturer at Sotheby’s Institute of Art in New York, the details of the Edition model that have been released look promising. She told DailyMail.com: 'Apple produces good design, and I hate to say it but good design is priceless. 'From what I have seen, the gold watch has a very elegant profile. The very slight curve shows that the design has been very well studied to fit on your wrist. I am curious to see how it actually feels. 'I wouldn't be surprised if customers have the option of keeping the strap and the casing but updating the software, which would create loyalty and longevity.' Serdari, who also lectures on product and fashion design at NYU, notes that Apple is following the classic launch strategy of designer brands like Chanel, which uses pricing to carve a position in the market. 'Chanel targets a broad market and in order to maintain the air of luxury increases the prices often very steeply. Shoe-in: Apple poached Burberry's CEO Angela Ahrendts to help make a play for the fashion world . Fashionable: Yves Saint Laurent's Paul Deneve (left) and designer Mark Newson (right) also worked on it . 'If the watch is $10,000, it would be a great way for Apple to differentiate itself from the gadget-based market, which is highly competitive. 'In my opinion, Apple is very well positioned to make the transition to move up.' If successful, the Edition Watch could act as a springboard for Apple to rocket into its bulls-eye: China. Tim Cook has repeatedly remarked that he predicts China to eventually overtake America as their biggest market. The popularity of the iPhone 6 drove the firm's market share in China to a record high, reaching 25.4 per cent by January 2015 - clouding out Samsung as the country's second-largest seller. However, Xiaomi - widely dubbed 'the Apple of China' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market. Venturing into watches and potentially other wearables, with Ahrendts at the helm, could be the leap that clinches it. Dawson said: 'They could really move into anything - necklaces, bracelets, brooches... It's not clear how those might feature a screen to function in the way that a watch does. But Apple is certainly in a position to try.'", 'generated_text': "the company will unveil the new apple Watch Edition on Monday. the 18-carat gold, sapphire and crystal have a reported $10,000. analyst for Sotheby's says the move could be the start of a new market.", 'ref_text': "<START-1>Apple Watch Edition is set to be priced at $10,000 on Monday's launch .\n18-carat gold, sapphire and crystal product would be firm's most expensive item since 1983 .\nIt is Apple's first move from affordable luxury into the luxury goods market .\nTechnology analyst and luxury goods analyst both tell DailyMail.com they are confident the product has the potential to succeed in the market .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8827419281005859, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}

Learner drivers undergoing a compulsory theory course on drink-driving have been invited to discuss several rape scenarios where alcohol is involved. The organisation behind the material has defended the use of questions involving rape, saying it is intended to inspire discussion about using alcohol 'as an excuse when you do something stupid'. Anger: Sweden's driver's licence examiner asked learner drivers to discuss if it is 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance' if a woman is drunk during a sexual assault (stock image) The theory booklet is used across Sweden for compulsory risk-assessment courses as part of the drivers licence theory exam, which mostly undertaken by 16 to 18-year-olds. Learner drivers are asked to discuss several scenarios where alcohol and drugs are involved, including two about rape with no relation to traffic or driving. The book asks: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished, is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?' It also described a similar rape-scenario where the male perpetrator is 'intoxicated' and whether that would be 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance' in court. Linnea Risinger, 32, from Falun, Dalarna, spotted the questions during her course, and posted a picture of it on her Facebook. The two questions read: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?,' and similarly 'An intoxicated man rapes a woman' Unrelated question: The questions were asked during a compulsory course which all learner drivers in Sweden must undergo in order to get their licence (stock image) The picture caused heated reactions, with many asking what the rape scenarios had to do with getting a driver's licence. Ms Risinger said she had been surprised to see the questions, especially as there could be victims of sexual assault forced to take part in discussions about rape in a context where they could not be expected to be prepared for them. 'Rape has nothing to do with a driver's licence,' Ms Risinger, a spokesperson for the local Green Party, told Aftonbladet. 'It is not okay that you should be forced to discuss during a compulsory course to get your licence. 'It is highly likely that there are boys and girls who take part in this course who are victims. They are there to get a driver's licence, not go to therapy.'

Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg today faced a grilling from TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats’ name, and what the election was all about . The unlikely duo appeared to hit it off, and later posed for a selfie at the event at the National Liberal Club in London . In tribute to the star's blunder, the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat . On the second day of the election campaign, Mr Clegg launched the Lib Dem manifesto for mental health. But amongst the journalists and broadcasters in the audience was the 24-year-old reality TV star, who is said to be making a documentary for ITV 2 on the election. Essex questioned why every party thinks they are right about everything, what is the point of voting Lib Dem and told Mr Clegg that being Deputy Prime Minister must be ‘sick’. The unlikely duo appeared to hit it off, and later posed for a selfie. But the most bizarre exchange came when the unlikely interviewer asked about the party’s name. ‘Why are they called Liberal Democats? It’s a long word innit?’ Essex asked. Mr Clegg tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988. ‘There used to be a Liberal Party. And then used to be a party called the Social Democrats. ‘This was before my time, they got together and created the Liberal Democrats.’ ‘Oh so you teamed up?,’ said Essex. 'I wondered that because it’s a weird word, innit? It’s got cats in it.’ Laughing, Mr Clegg tried to put him right. ‘It’s not “cats”, it’s “crats”.’ The penny finally dropped. ‘Oh it’s “crats”. I thought it was “cats”. Oh wicked.’ Mr Clegg tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988 which saw the creation of the Liberal Democrats . The conversation moved on to the merits of power, and just how much Mr Clegg wields. ‘You are basically like, you rule this country right?’ ‘I’ve been Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years,’ Mr Clegg replied. ‘That’s sick. I sort of rule Essex. I was going to say, someone else will be Prime Minister next? Are you going to be Prime Minister?' The Lib Dem leader, currently on around 8 per cent in the polls, had to admit this was unlikely. ‘I would love to be Prime Minister but I’ve got to be open with you Joey, I don’t think I am going to win this election outright. ‘I do think that like last time the debate will be about which mixture of parties in government. If you speak to Ed Miliband and David Cameron they will say they are going to win outright, they won’t do. ‘Everybody knows they are not going to win outright.’ Essex is due to interview Labour’s Ed Miliband and Tory leader David Cameron during the election campaign. Mr Clegg said that he should challenge them both on the idea that either of them can win outright. ‘When you speak them, they will tell you both that they will win. Everyone knows they are not going to win outright. ‘The question is who do you want making decisions who have got the right values and instincts and feelings about stuff. I think the Liberal Democrats - not “cats” - have shown in the last five years have got good instincts.’ Joey Essex was in the audience for the Lib Dem leader's morning press conference on mental health and NHS funding . Essex is due to interview Labour’s Ed Miliband and Tory leader David Cameron during the election campaign . Somewhat stating the obvious, Essex admitted that he does not ‘really know much about all the politics’. It was only his second day in his job as a roving reporter on the campaign trail and so far ‘at the moment to me everyone just seems to want to win’. ‘Everybody is fighting for the same position. I don’t really get it,’ he said, telling Mr Clegg: ‘You’ve taught me a lot about Liberal Democrats. At least I know the name now.’ Pointing to his all-white outfit, he added: ‘I was meant to be wearing a suit today but they didn’t tell me I was meeting a leader.’ Essex later said he thought was a 'nice bloke, to be fair', adding: 'He was honest, he told me he weren't going to win - I think honesty is the best policy. 'If - not saying I'm going to be Prime Minister - I was going to lose something and genuinely thought I was going to lose, I would be honest and say I was going to lose. I think that was quite a nice thing of him to say. He was a nice guy.' He added that he was 'excited' about meeting the Labour and Tory leaders: 'David Cameron is the Prime Minister. 'But to be fair, to me, they are all prime ministers. They're all on TV, they're all doing good things, they're all trying to make people happy, so in my eyes they're all nice people really - like, at the moment anyway, until I maybe meet one of them and he's not nice. 'But they're all sweet at the moment.' Asked if there were any words politicians should use, Essex laughed as he replied: 'They could use reem. No, I'm joking. They could use that, but they won't.'", 'generated_text': "Democrat leader Nick Clegg faced a grilling from TOWIE star Joey Essex. in tribute to the star's blunder, the party changed the logo on its website. in tribute to the star's blunder, the party changed the logo on its website. in tribute to the star's blunder, the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat.", 'ref_text': "<START-1>TOWIE star interviews Lib Dem leader on second day of campaign .\nBoasts that he 'rules' Essex but does not understand the election .\nAsks about 'weird' party name which 'has the word cats in it'\nUnlikely duo pose for a selfie after Lib Dem mental health launch .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8333615660667419, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}
2023-01-26 13:56:20,596 [INFO] {'split_name': 'val', 'sample_id': 'val_787', 'prompt_text': 'Summarize: Los Angeles (CNN)Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, has reached a plea deal: He would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped, court papers says. The deal would require prosecutors to recommend probation for Hilton, who also allegedly called passengers "peasants" on a London-to-Los Angeles flight last summer. Hilton, 20, is scheduled to appear Thursday in federal court, but he is not expected to plead guilty at that time, said spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney\'s Office. Hilton, who is free on $100,000 bond, was initially charged with a felony that could have carried a prison sentence up to 20 years upon a conviction. The misdemeanor charge carries up to a six-month prison sentence and a fine of at least $5,000, but federal prosecutors have agreed that they would "recommend that defendant be sentenced to a term of probation," court records said. The class B misdemeanor accuses Hilton of assaulting two flight attendants aboard a British Airways flight on July 31, 2014, "by intentionally using a display of force that reasonably caused (the attendants) to fear immediate bodily harm," according to court documents filed last week. Hilton signed court papers last week that state he "repeatedly entered the bathroom to smoke marijuana and tobacco" during Flight 269 from London to Los Angeles, court papers said. Read the plea deal . "He also become belligerent toward some of the flight attendants," according to court papers signed by Hilton and his attorney. His attorney couldn\'t be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. At one point, Hilton told one flight attendant multiple times that "I am going to f------ kill you," according to the court papers. Hilton also "punched at, but missed" another flight attendant, the court documents said. A more complete description of events aboard the flight was provided in initial court papers filed in early February. Those alleged Hilton threatened and intimidated flight attendants, scared parents and disengaged a bathroom smoke alarm. The court documents alleged Hilton punched the bulkhead next to an attendant\'s head, missing his face by about 4 inches, and told the crew, "I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss!" "My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time," Hilton allegedly told a flight attendant. Hilton\'s father is Rick Hilton, the grandson of the Hilton Hotel empire\'s founder, Conrad Nicholson Hilton. Rick Hilton and his wife of more than 30 years, Kathy, are parents of four children: Paris, Nicky, Barron and Conrad. Conrad Hilton left his seat five minutes after takeoff, even though the "fasten seat belt" sign was still on, authorities said. Another flight attendant said Hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10½-hour flight, court documents said. Read the initial federal complaint (Warning: profane language) When Hilton became enraged because a flight attendant was following him, he shouted several times that "I am going to f------ kill you!" and used other vulgarities, court papers said. Passengers became frightened and disturbed, authorities said. A French family was seated behind Hilton, and the father got out of his seat and leaned "over his kids in a protective gesture" during one of Hilton\'s rants, a flight attendant told authorities, according to court papers. Hilton yelled several times, saying "I will f------ own anyone on this flight; they are f------ peasants." Hilton also accused the flight attendants of "taking the peasants\' side" and then said he was angry because he had just broken up with a girlfriend, court papers said. He bragged that he was already banned by other airlines. At some point during the flight, the attendant saw Hilton go into a bathroom and smelled cigarette smoke coming from it, authorities said. The flight\'s pilot, who was second-in-command to the captain, "noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels, apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding," court papers said. The pilot later confronted Hilton, and Hilton surrendered a used pack of cigarettes and a lighter, authorities said. Hilton returned to his seat and fell asleep. The captain authorized crew members to form a "restraint team" to constrain Hilton before he woke up, authorities said in court papers. The crew used a blanket and handcuffs on Hilton about 75 minutes before the plane landed, authorities said. He awoke while being restrained and began screaming obscenities, court documents said. "As Hilton was being restrained, he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were \'going to ruin my career,\' " according to an affidavit by FBI agent David Gates filed in court in early February. Later, in an interview with the FBI the same day, Hilton said he started his travels in Mykonos, Greece, had a connection in Athens, and then traveled to London, authorities said. He took a sleeping pill before boarding the flight to Los Angeles, court papers said. Hilton admitted to calling people "peasants" on the flight, but he "denied having a confrontation with a flight attendant near the start of the flight but acknowledged having other issues with flight attendants," the affidavit said.

We rely on them every day. To do our jobs, drop the kids off at school, or take an elderly relative shopping. Cars mean freedom and independence, and most importantly of all, convenience. But years of crazy parking rules have made many law-abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals, and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses. We all know the story. You return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen. Or maybe you run a local shop, and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee. Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) have vowed to end the 'war on the motorist' with their new 'common sense' approach . In 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end. That meant not only changing the rules, but changing attitudes, because under the previous Government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny, treating them like cash machines on wheels. This included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives. Where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post. If you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine, or an angry bailiff knocking on your door. And all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by Parliament. Residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence. The minister says they want to see 'fairness and balance' restored to the system so parking no longer generates profit . These rules have now been changed during this parliament. Local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines. Parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued. They have also vowed to end the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking . We are bringing back common sense. Very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute 'grace periods' for council-controlled parking, whether it's on or off-street, paid or free. It means you won't get fined for being a few minutes late. We're also ending the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking. The new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post, but ensure public safety as CCTV will still be used to protect schools, bus lanes and red routes. Why have we done this? Because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system. As a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we're cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs. And in another victory for common sense parking at an out-of-order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay. There are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they've done nothing wrong. We'll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you, you'll receive a 25% discount even if the appeal is lost. These changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too. People supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce. Under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring.

She was turned down for life-changing surgery on the NHS. But cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers. The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery at the same Leeds hospital trust which gave aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham breast enlargements. And even when readers raised £55,000 to pay for Sophie’s surgery her family were told by NHS doctors she was ‘not disabled enough’ to qualify – despite not being able to walk. But the toddler has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the United States this autumn. It means that, by the time she is four, Sophie could be walking. Sophie was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy. She needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery, which involves cutting the nerves in her spine, to be able to walk freely. Sophie has strengthened her legs ahead of the operation using a specially-adapted £1,200 bicycle bought from readers’ donations. Doctors said this means she is an ‘ideal candidate’ for the surgery and is likely to be able to walk completely unaided afterwards. Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘Sophie wiped my face and she said “Mummy why are you crying?” I told her she was going to be able to walk and she said “Yes!”. ‘By the time she is four she could be walking. It’s very, very emotional, we just can’t believe it. ‘It is frustrating that Leeds turned us down but now we know that Sophie is going to have the best surgeon, so that is more reassuring. If anything goes wrong at least we know we did everything we could for her. ‘As it gets nearer I’m sure the nerves will kick in - it’s a big operation. But it’s what she needs and it’s the best thing for her. ‘Sophie understands now that she is going to walk.

2023-01-26 14:04:12,823 [INFO] {'split_name': 'test', 'sample_id': 'test_5344', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: ALFRED HITCHCOCK . by Peter Ackroyd . (Chatto & Windus £12.99 . With this nutritious, compact and superb critical biography, Ackroyd emphasises the importance of Victorian and Edwardian London in the imagination of Alfred Hitchcock — the ‘damp-looking dirty blackness’ of the East End; the ‘manifold ruffianism’ of the Cockneys; the pubs, street markets, theatres and music halls, with their ‘variety acts, dioramas and Italian operettas’. Alfred Hitchcock (pictured) was born in 1899 in Leytonstone, East London . In addition to the gaudiness, the city was a place with dark staircases, gaslight, rain and spooky cobbled alleys: the ideal setting for murder. Hitchcock was born in 1899 in Leytonstone, East London, the son of a wholesale grocer. They were a Catholic family, Irish originally, and the boy who would become ‘one of the most distinguished directors in the world’ was educated by the Jesuits. The bullying Christian Brothers may have taught ‘the virtues of order, control and precision’, but they also instilled (with the strap) a belief in mystery and miracles. The logic and reason, coupled with a mood of anxiety, dread and paranoid suspicion, seeped into Hitchcock’s work: ‘He thought everyone was doing something physical and nasty behind every closed door’. Looking back on his schooldays, he said that, as the Jesuits had frightened him, ‘now I’m getting my own back by terrifying other people’. Hitchcock was never any oil painting. A 5 ft 7 in Humpty Dumpty, he was the neurotic fat boy with piggy eyes, who was filled with ‘lavish and peculiar’ repressed sexual fantasies. His entire oeuvre, Ackroyd suggests, was a study of voyeurism, violence and guilt with, on the one hand, the rape and murder of vulnerable women, and, on the other, the pursuit of a hero accused of crimes he did not commit. His very first work, in 1927, The Lodger, was about a man wrongly accused of being Jack The Ripper and, already, Hitchcock could whip up an atmosphere of ‘doubt and suspense’, the camera dwelling on ‘dark puddles shimmering with opalescent light’. His opening in movies began at the studios in Islington and Twickenham, where Hitchcock created the captions for silent movies and designed the title cards. Here, he met Alma Reville, whom he married in 1926. Alma was an editor who ‘emphasised the importance of smooth continuity and the subtle use of close-up’. She was thin and boyish, wearing trouser-suits tailored at Austin Reed, ‘the gentlemen’s outfitters’. The Hitchcocks lived at 153 Cromwell Road and had one daughter, Patricia. Apart from conceiving Patricia, Ackroyd assures us, Hitchcock and Alma never had sex together again. Ackroyd goes into raptures about The Lodger, which starred Ivor Novello. ‘The use of light was its music, rising in intensity, in the process creating a unique rhythm of meaning’. Would Hitchcock have seen it this way? The shower scene from Hitchcock's Psycho (Janet Leigh pictured playing Marion Crane in the film) is one of the most recognisable shots in cinematic history . When he wrote his granddaughter’s film studies essay for her, he (or she) was awarded a C. ‘Well, I’m sorry. That’s the best I can do,’ he said, grumpily. But it never does to ask an artist to explain his own flavour and texture — it makes for self-consciousness. Such was Hitchcock’s critical and popular success that, by the early Thirties, he was earning £13,000 a year — £700,000 in today’s money. His skill was to merge larger-than-life melodramas — bombs, assassins, enemy agents — with mundane tasks and anxieties, about catching trains, losing a tie-pin, or (notoriously) taking a shower. He moved to Hollywood in 1939, to make Rebecca with Laurence Olivier. The Hitchcocks bought a house in Bel Air and an 85-acre ranch in Santa Cruz. The brightness of California’s blue pools and red clay tennis courts was in marked contrast to London’s charcoal murk yet, as in his English films, Hitchcock found that, in the sunshine, ‘fear became an intrinsic aspect of daily life’. Cary Grant, Gregory Peck and James Stewart were now his wrongly accused leading men. Kim Novak, Tippi Hedren and Grace Kelly were his ‘ideal blonde beauties’, the women alone, menaced by intruders. Princess Grace, in particular, was described by Hitchcock as ‘a volcano covered with snow’ — with the implication that these ice maidens rather liked being plunged into dangerous situations, because it aroused them. He was respected, but not liked. With the stars, Hitchcock was awkward, even contemptuous, calling them ‘cattle’. Marlene Dietrich called him ‘a strange little man. I didn’t like him’, and Hitchcock had an unfortunate fondness for cruel practical jokes — plying people with drinks laced with laxatives, handcuffing people and losing the key. He also ‘had a schoolboy’s obsession with sex that went on and on in a very peculiar way’, the dirty jokes accompanied by salacious groping. Hitchcock (pictured with his two granddaughters) was respected in the industry, but not liked.\xa0Marlene Dietrich called him ‘a strange little man. I didn’t like him’ Then there’s Hitchcock’s clammy behaviour towards Tippi Hedren during the making of The Birds and Marnie — ‘he was almost obsessed with me,’ says the actress, ‘and it’s very difficult to be the object of someone’s obsession’. Ackroyd valiantly tries to defend the director’s control freakery by arguing that Hitchcock was doing nothing worse than deliberately trying to elicit a nervous and terrified performance for the cameras.’ Through provocation and bullying, says Ackroyd, Hitchcock was being professional. It was a strategy. Hmm. I think I prefer Francois Truffaut’s observation that ‘Hitchcock filmed scenes of murder as if they were love scenes, and scenes of love as if they were scenes of murder’. The camera always lingers on faces that could be wracked with either pain or pleasure. (‘When he sticks it in her,’ he gleefully instructed his cinematographer prior to shooting a rape sequence, ‘I want the camera right on her face!’) Victims swoon. Hands grasp a neck — strangulation is an embrace, for example, in Strangers On A Train or the shocking despatch of Anna Massey in Frenzy. Everybody remembers Psycho, with Anthony Perkins as the ‘excitable and sexually ambiguous’ Norman Bates — a thin version of Hitchcock himself, it seems. In the shower scene, ‘chocolate syrup was used for the blood’. A smashing detail I hadn’t known before. The audiences screamed to such an extent, Hitchcock pocketed a profit of $15 million. In The Birds, gulls and crows were flung at Tippi Hedren in an attic set for five days solid, scratching her to pieces. Live birds were tied to her body with elastic bands, so that they’d bounce about and flap and perch on her face. ‘The actual biting is done by glove puppets,’ Ackroyd maintains. But a lot of those pecks look genuine — Hitchcock’s revenge, it is said, because Hedren had rejected his advances. Hitchcock died in 1980 from ailments related to obesity and alcoholism: colitis, arthritis, gall stones, renal failure. He’d done more than anyone since Edgar Allan Poe to make our flesh creep.

Like so many new mothers, Nicola Bonn, 34, from London was learning on the job and found the whole experience 'exciting yet utterly petrifying'. Scroll down for video . Nicola Bonn, 34, from London, started a candid blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, and many of her posts have gone viral . She wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did. One of her blog posts, Why We Need to Stop Justifying Ourselves, went viral - no doubt thanks to her candid account of bringing up a baby for the first time. Here, she shares it with FEMAIL... 'Since becoming a mama I’ve spent way too much time explaining myself and almost apologising for my decisions and I’ve decided that it has to stop. 'The problem is that when you have a baby, everyone has an opinion and they’re often not afraid to air it which can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced than the 'advice giver' and is most probably filled with high levels of self doubt.

She believes one of the main hurdles is that everyone has an opinion and they're often not afraid to air it, which. she says, can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced . 'Over the past year, countless people have questioned decisions that I have made. They always do it in this seemingly innocent but quite obviously judgemental way that is hair-pullingly irritating and invariably follow it with a comment about what they might do better. 'Off the top of my head, here are some examples: . 1. You’re still feeding Poppy milk when she wakes up during the night? Oh I wouldn’t do that..she’s far too old. 2. You rock her to sleep? Do you not think she should be self settling at this age? 3. You encourage her to play with her food? Isn’t that encouraging bad manners? 4. You don’t breast feed? You do know that it really is best for bonding? 5. You take her on the underground? It’s full of germs. Why do you do that? 'Instead of doing what I should and saying 'yes I do' in a firm but polite way and ending the conversation there, I always go into great detail about why I do these things. 'No, I don’t breast feed because I find it really tough. I tried but I couldn’t do it and it was actually affecting the bonding process. I do express though…lots and it’s  exhausting but I do it because I’m trying to do my best. Nicola often finds other mothers saying to her: 'You encourage her to play with her food? Isn't that encouraging bad manners?' but says she\xa0has to believe in the choices that she makes on a daily basis because if she starts doubting herself then it won't do anyone any good…least of all Poppy . 'Yes, I sometimes rock her to sleep because she loves it and it helps her to settle. I know it’s probably not advisable at her age but it means that she goes to sleep faster and I’m knackered and I need a break and a glass of wine ASAP! 'Yes, I take her on the underground. I can’t drive and that’s how we get around and she loves it. It’s not as if she’s actually licking the floor…well even if she does it can’t be as bad as the toddler who licked the loo brush in Mc Donalds and he didn’t die did he? 'Why do I do this? Why can’t I just believe in my instinct and decisions? None of them have been taken lightly, there is a reason for all of them and as a mother, I have to believe in the choices that I make on a daily basis because if I start doubting myself then it won’t do anyone any good…least of all Poppy. Nicola says that the next time women feel judged for a decision that they have made concerning their child, they shouldn't explain themselves because, after all, they know their child better than anyone else does . 'I’m the first person to ask for advice when I need it and I often do. 'In fact, I think that one of the most beautiful things about motherhood is women passing on wisdom that they have learnt from generation to generation. It creates a magical bond amongst us that makes you proud to be a female and more importantly a mother. But, there is a difference between kindly passing on wisdom and questioning and judging fellow mamas. 'So, next time we feel judged for a decision that we have made concerning our child, let’s not explain ourselves. 'Instead, let’s believe in what we are doing and keep doing it. We know our children better than anyone else does and we are their mothers and that counts for everything!'.", 'generated_text': ": From the lack of sleep to breastfeeding, becoming a mother for the first time is no mean feat.

An army recruitment sergeant who is accused of carrying out a campaign of abuse against female cadets allegedly locked a female recruit in an office and raped her. Edwin \'Jock\' Mee, who worked at the military base in Croydon, south London, allegedly invited the young woman in for an appointment to discuss her application to join the Army and locked the doors of the room they were in . The woman, now 27, told Southwark Crown Court that Mee raped her as he called her a \'sweet woman\'. She claims she became pregnant before suffering a life threatening ectopic pregnancy. Mee is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre between October 2010 and September 2011.\xa0The divorced father-of-five denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Many of his vulnerable victims were threatened with deportation if they did not submit to his sexual demands, the court was previously told. One of his alleged victims claimed she was told by Mee she would \'need to be nice to him\' when she met him for her first application appointment. The woman had arrived in England from her Sierra Leone homeland in 2007 when she was 19. She told the jury she had been \'inspired\' to join the Army by her then-fiance, but said Mee littered their first meeting with comments about her \'boobs\', her looks and saying that he \'liked her\'. Speaking from behind a curtain she told the jury: \'He told me a little bit about him and his ex-wife. He said that if I help him, he will help me through my application but if I f*** with him...\' She then said \'excuse me\' to the jury before continuing his sentence adding that he said \'he will f*** with me\'. Earlier in the interview at the Scottish recruitment sergeant\'s office in Croydon, south London, he had asked her about her background and then asked if she was a prostitute. When she replied no she claimed Mee make a comment about her breasts. She started attending the\xa0Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office (ACIO) in Croydon, once or twice a week on Mee\'s orders after completing her British Army Recruitment Battery test, desperate to find out if she had secured a job. After she had asked about the progress of her application he invited her in for a 6pm appointment to discuss it, and left her waiting almost two hours, jurors were told. The woman, now 27, claims she asked Mee why he had brought her there and he told her she would have to wait, making her nervous. Scroll down for video . Giving evidence from behind a screen she said: \'He came and asked me to sit on his lap and I told him I can\'t.\' The sergeant then stormed off and while she was waiting, she could hear Mee locking the doors, she claimed. \'Then he said "I want you to make love to me" and I said "Jock" and he said "there is no other way, the front door is locked, there is no camera in here and the door is closed2 so I have to choose,\' added the woman. \'I said "I can\'t", he said "you have to do that".\' Mee, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court earlier this week, has denied 17 counts of sexual assault . Mee boasted about going to prison and \'fighting\' and used \'threatening remarks and gestures\', jurors heard. \'He said if you don\'t want to do it then you can\'t leave,\' she said. The sergeant then held her hands behind her back, telling her: \'You have to use this door, I have the keys.\' The woman then wept as she told jurors Mee raped her. She told the court that she turned to her GP after suffering \'severe\' pain following the alleged brutal rape. \'During that period for two nights running I had severe tummy aches so I had to go to my GP,\' she said. \'The GP said I have to do a test, I had to take a pregnancy test before I could take things further,\' she said. The woman claims she spoke to Mee after she had a miscarriage but she never saw him again. Mee\'s alleged victim suffered a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy and was operated on at St Helier Hospital in Surrey. \'Did you tell anybody about what had happened with Jock Mee and the baby and the story at that time?\' asked Rosina Cottage QV, prosecuting. \'At the time I didn\'t tell anyone anything because I was really stressed,\' she replied. When investigators from the army knocked on her door, she was so frightened she pretended to be someone else, the court heard. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The British Army recruiting sergeant worked at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon in Careers and Information . Southwark Crown Court also heard evidence from another alleged victim who claimed she gave up her hopes of being in the Army when she was 17 because the attentions of Mee, who allegedly asked her if she was a virgin, made her feel \'very uncomfortable.\' Speaking from behind a curtain, the woman, who is almost 22, told London\'s Southwark Crown Court: \'He just smacked my bottom on the way out.\' She told the jury that \'he did not say anything\', adding: \'I was just very shocked and a bit overwhelmed. I did not know what to say. I was not expecting that to happen. I was speechless. I did not know what to say.\' She also claimed he pestered her with questions about her personal life, asking her about eight times to go out for a drink and whether her mother would let her stay at his house. He would also \'stare\' at her chest during the interviews, she told the court. The woman had applied to join the Army in March 2011 but had abandoned the plan by December that year, after being asked by Mee to go for a drink with him about eight times. She said: \'I just stopped training. I felt very uncomfortable about it. My interest was diverted by what I was experiencing - the unprofessionalism. It was just not somewhere I wanted to be near.\' Lisa Wilding QC, defending, claimed the incidents did not happen and suggested that when Mee found out they shared the same birthday, he only said \'make sure you do not drink too much, it will affect your training\'. The woman responded sharply: \'That is a lie.\' The trial, which is expected to last six or eight weeks, continues.

The rate of bankruptcy, 15.7percent - remained the same no matter how long the players were in the league or how well they were paid, according to researchers from the California Institute of Technology, George Washington University and the University of Washington. Despite earning millions of dollars - sometimes tens of millions - former players go broke at about 1.1percent per year, the same rate as the rest of Americans. Bleak future: Despite NFL players earning millions - sometimes times of millions - over the course of their careers, nearly 16percent of players are bankrupt within 12 years . Vince Young earned a reported $64million in salary and endorsement deals - but was bankrupt before he even finished his NFL career. Widely reported rumors say he spent $5,000 a week at Cheesecake factory . Though bleak, the 15.7percent figure found by the researchers, is dramatically lower than a widely quoted statistic that 78percent of retired players are bankrupt or under 'financial stress' within two years of leaving the league. The figure comes from a 2009 survey by Sports Illustrated. Often, when athletes go broke, it's because of unimaginable extravagances, bad investments and massive child support payments. \xa0This, despite the fact that the average player makes $3.2million over the course of a career. Defensive tackle Warren Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL and made more than $82million. He retired in 2007 and filed for bankruptcy in 2012 - citing several failed business ventures. Bankruptcy remained at similar rates even among players who had long, profitable careers in the sport - though it was highest for those who stayed in the league for five years - and lower for those who were in it for more than a decade . Michael Vick, who made more than $130million, is still playing has he attempts to pay off his $18million bankruptcy debt from 2008 . When his estate was sold at auction, he had a lionskin rug and 240 pairs of sneakers. He also owed more than $75,000 a month in child support for his six children (with five different women,) Quarterback Vince Young's played his last NFL game in December 2011. He filed for bankruptcy in January 2014 - despite earning $34million in salary and another $30million in endorsement deals. Widely reported rumors that emerged after he first began having financial trouble in 2012 claim that he spent up to $5,000 a week at Cheesecake Factory and racked up a $6,000 tab at TGI Friday's. Young also blamed investment advisers who he claimed took advantage of him. Quarterback Michael Vick filed for bankruptcy in 2008 - in the middle of his high-profile career and legal troubles that sent him to prison. He was still paying off his $18million in debts in 2014 - despite making $130million from the NFL and millions more from endorsement deals.

The 26-year-old from Burnham-on-Sea won the 2013 BMX world title and was the World Cup series champion in 2014. Phillips, who races in the Manchester World Cup event this weekend, plans to use 2015 to experiment with tactics in a bid to arrive at the start gate in Rio full of confidence. Liam Phillips in action during the 2012 Olympics, and the 26-year-old is hoping for glory in Rio . 'There are certain areas I need to improve to get on the gate in Rio and know that I've done everything I can to be as good, if not better, than my competitors in every single area,' Phillips said. 'The sport is continuing to improve and I need to continue to improve. 'There's challenges this season that I would love to accomplish, which don't necessarily mean going to a race and winning. 'Last year in Argentina I was in second and almost passed the reigning Olympic champion (Latvia's Maris Strombergs) for the win. 'That's something I feel I'd like a little bit more exposure to - not being out in front and having to try to pass some of the best guys to come back and win. That would add to my box of tricks come the Olympics.' Phillips would dearly love to reclaim the world title he won in Auckland two years ago at this year's World Championships in Belgium in July. 2013 World Champion Phillips hopes to use this year to hone his tactics ahead of the 2016 Olympics . The Somerset ace was the taken out by an ill-thought manoeuvre by France's Damien Godet in Rotterdam last year, ending his stint in the rainbow jersey. Phillips knows his performances in recent seasons mean he is a key rival others will do anything to beat. 'I do have a target on me, because I have performed at a high level over the last few years and I have been world champion,' he added. 'Last year's World Championships was so frustrating because I sacrificed doing a few races before then because I wanted to chuck everything at retaining that title. 'I was absolutely flying and I know that given the opportunity to continue racing I would certainly have been more than capable of retaining that, but that's BMX. 'It's just the nature of it. I don't like to dwell on that. I want to push forward now.' Phillips won the Manchester World Cup event in 2014 and knows he will be expected to perform once again on his home track in Saturday's time-trials and Sunday's Super Cross, where eight riders race at the same time. Phillips failed to defend his title last year, but is determined to take it back this July in Belgium . He added: 'I look back at the World Cup last year and I've never experienced pressure like that. Being reigning world champion, everybody expects you to win. 'There's 150 guys in the race, but everybody is looking at this as my race. It's something I seem to be able to manage and thrive on in some respects.' Phillips leads a five-rider British team, which also features 2014 World Championships bronze medallist Tre Whyte, Kyle Evans and Quillan Isidore.

Ten years ago, bartender Liz Clark did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world. The 34-year-old left her home in San Diego, California, when she was given a Cal 40 sailboat on the condition that she sail the globe and document her travels. Scroll down for video . Ten years ago, bartender Liz Clark did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world . The 34-year-old promised to document her travels on a Cal 40 sailboat after being handed inspiration from a retired professor . And for the last decade Liz has been enjoying an idyllic life as she sails alone in a sailboat, travelling about 25,000 nautical miles to date. 'After I graduated from university, I happened to cross paths with a retired professor, Dr. Arent H. Schuyler, who was looking for someone to sail his boat around the world,' says Liz. 'He was 80 years old at the time and just wanted to help someone else realize his dream.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance. She says: 'At university I learned about all the damage we were doing to the Earth and the unsustainable lifestyles we were leading. 'I looked around me and it seemed like no one was doing anything about it, and I decided that I really didn't want to be a part of it anymore. 'I knew this trip would be everything I loved in one-a simple, eco-friendly lifestyle close to nature, searching for remote uncrowded waves, learning from other cultures, challenging myself physically and mentally, and going on an open-ended adventure.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance to discover the world . As well as perfect her sailing skills, the ten-year trip has helped Liz perfect her surf-boarding talents . Sailing around the world offers Liz the perfect chance for scenic stop-offs to practise yoga . After graduating from university, Liz worked as a bartender for three years, before quitting her job when the opportunity to sail around the world arose. She spent three years preparing for her voyage and learning how to operate the sailboat. Liz says: 'It was petrifying to leave the safety and security of the dock and my friends and family. 'I didn't know if I would be capable of captaining a boat this big and managing all that goes into a trip where you're off the grid and away from any help - but I knew I had to try or I'd always regret it. 'When I left I didn't know how I'd make money, and I don't come from a wealthy family or anything, like many people assume. 'I was writing blogs the first year and from this I developed a close relationship with Patagonia, an outdoors clothing company - who have been my main financial supporter since the beginning.' It's often hard work for Liz, as she is photographed here \xa0fixing the anchor in the ground to secure her boat in the eastern South Pacific . Liz did make a friend when she visited Tahiti in 2013, and even took the cat on the boat with her . Her travels around the world have given Liz memories to treasure forvever, including enjoying herself with the locals in Panama in 2007 . Setting off in October 2005, Liz has travelled to a number of exotic destinations, including Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Liz has documented her travels in a series of envy inducing photographs. She used a timer to take some of the pictures herself, while other photos were taken by locals. Photo shows Liz relaxing in the South Pacific in 2014; the former bartender admits to sometimes becoming lonely, and right, some deep sea diving . There was a prime catch on this trip in the eastern Pacific, but Liz would have wanted to share the meal with somebody . Liz feeds some small sharks whilst on an outer island in the French Polynesia in 2011, during her ten year trip around the world . Liz's daily routine includes adjusting sails and boat maintenance, as well as surfing, yoga, swimming and sleeping under the stars. She says: 'People are generally either awed or jealous, others are totally inspired and excited. 'It feels so great to inspire others to live their dreams, but it's impossible to explain to them what this life is really like; how much hard work there is and that it isn't always easy or fun. 'But that's part of living your dreams - it's never easy, but no work is ever as hard when it's part of your dreams and moving you towards your desires.' The journey throws up daily challenges for Liz, shown here as she battles tough weather in the eastern Pacific in 2008 . A spectacular selfie shows a huge wave forms int he background in the South Pacific in 2012 . The trip offered Liz the chance to do some teaching at a school in outer islands French Polynesia, in 2011 . Liz says: 'I get lonely at times and still hope to find a complimentary sailing partner. 'The kindness of strangers wherever I go, along with the remote love and support from family and friends, always fills up that emptiness whenever I feel a void.' In 2011, the man responsible for Liz's adventure, Dr. Schuyler, died, aged 87. Liz says: 'He never wanted to be on the boat. He just wanted to help me live my dream and live vicariously through me. 'That's how my blog originally started, because I wanted him to be able to share my experiences.'

2023-01-26 14:04:12,904 [INFO] {'split_name': 'test', 'sample_id': 'test_290', 'prompt_text': 'Summarize: (CNN)Two Delaware boys are in a coma and their father still is unable to talk or move two weeks after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands, their lawyer said Saturday. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens\' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family\'s lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said. "The boys are in rough shape," Maron said. "The family are all fighters," he added. "They\'re fighting for everything right now. I understand it\'s a long recovery." Esmond, also being treated at a hospital, is conscious but cannot move, Maron said. The teens\' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital but released, and is now in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family began had been renting since March 14. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency\'s preliminary test results "do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying." Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It\'s not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. "It\'s an ongoing investigation; we\'re still on the island doing our assessment," Rodriguez said. "We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling." Final test results were expected next week. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Maron, the family\'s attorney, declined to comment on the investigation. Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. "Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services," the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is "committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment" and is "looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities." "We\'re thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery," Terminix wrote.

Marilyn Zuniga sparked outrage for allowing her third grade class in Orange, New Jersey, to pen letters to murderer\xa0Mumia Abu-Jamal, after he collapsed in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. Abu-Jamal, 60, is serving a life sentence in prison after he shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981. Marilyn Zuniga apologised after she allowed her students to write to convicted police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal after he became ill while serving a life sentence in prison, but said the students wanted to write to him . Ms Zuniga has apologised for publicising the efforts of her pupils online, but said they had wanted to write to Abu-Jamal, according to\xa0philly.com. Both her pupils and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union wrote to the killer. Ms Zuniga spoke at the Orange school board after she was suspended from her position while officials investigate. She explained that she had previously asked her class to consider Abu-Jamal's quote 'So long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.' She said when she told students the former Black Panther was ill, they had asked to write to him in prison. Ms Zuniga told the board she had made a mistake and was prepared to resign rather than be fired, to prevent damage to her career. Mumia's supporters say photos of the killer eleased this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is . Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . The letters caused many to criticize the actions of the teacher. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. He previously told Fox News: 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Abu Jamal was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Mr Faulkner in the back and then, once he was dead, in between the eyes. Abu-Jamal shot dead Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, shooting him at first in the back . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the killing, but this was overturned in 2012. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels which may be linked to diabetes. The killer's supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary.
