Chief executive Mark McCafferty admitted the four-year contract extension with BT Sport will feature in talks over setting the salary cap level for the 2016-17 Aviva Premiership season. Premiership bosses confirmed the new BT deal on Monday, extending the existing four-year contract until 2021. Premiership Rugby Chief executive Mark McCafferty admits the new BT Sport deal could raise the salary cap . McCafferty accepted the salary cap could 'possibly' rise again off the back of the BT deal - but not straight away. 'We've got the salary cap levels in place for the 2015-16 season next year, and we will start discussions with the clubs over the next few months on the cap for 2016-17 onwards,' said McCafferty. 'No doubt the new BT deal gives us some certainty against which to plan those discussions.' Premiership chiefs netted £152million when agreeing their first deal with BT Sport in 2012, and this new extension is expected to command a sizeable increase. The salary cap for the Aviva Premiership will be discussed for 2016-17 onwards in the next few months . Premiership clubs continue to battle the lure of big-money moves to France in the bid to retain their top stars. Northampton skipper Dylan Hartley rejected several lucrative contract offers from French clubs to commit to Franklin's Gardens earlier this season however, and league bosses will hope increasing revenue through deals similar to the BT contract will continue to boost that ongoing fight. The Premiership's salary cap is already set to rise to £5.1million for 2015-16, with clubs able to gain £400,000 in credits for the number of home-grown players in their squad. Premiership clubs will also be able to nominate two marquee players, whose salaries are not included in the cap. McCafferty believes progressive sponsorship and commercial arrangements like the new BT deal will continue to help Premiership clubs build squads potent both at home and abroad. Dylan Hartley (centre) \xa0raises the trophy for Northampton having won the 2014 Aviva Premiership . English and French clubs spent two years haggling over reform of the European rugby competitions, securing meritocratic qualification and record broadcasting investment in the process. For the first time since 1998, four English clubs have qualified for the quarter-finals of Europe's top club contest, in the inaugural European Champions Cup. 'We're particularly keen on all of the talent that we've been developing through the academies: those players have been breaking through into the England set-up at a younger age,' said McCafferty. 'We've got a good, strong, young English squad, and we've had strong performances in Europe from our top clubs.

2023-01-26 13:18:40,733 [INFO] {'split_name': 'val', 'sample_id': 'val_10971', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: Utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when the governor signed a law on Monday approving the method when no lethal injection drugs were available, even though he called it 'a little bit gruesome'. Utah is a capital punishment state and needs a backup execution method in case a shortage of the drugs persists,\xa0Republican Governor Gary Herbert said. 'We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty, and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued,' the governor's spokesman said. Scroll down for video . The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah in June 2010.\xa0Utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when Governor Gary Herbert signed a law Monday approving the method for use when no lethal injection drugs are available . However, enforcing death sentences is 'the obligation of the executive branch'. The governor's office noted that other states allow execution methods other than lethal injection. In Washington state, inmates can request hanging. In New Hampshire, hangings are fallback if lethal injections can't be given. Ronnie Lee Gardner, pictured above, was the last person killed by firing squad in the U.S. after choosing this method of execution. Gardner, 49, was executed on June 18, 2010, at 12.15am at Utah State Prison in Draper. In 1984, Gardner had killed Melvyn John Otterstrom, shooting him in the face during a robbery in Salt Lake City and leaving his body to be found by his wife. In April 1985, he shot dead attorney Michael Burdell at a court hearing as he tried to escape. He was given a life sentence for the first murder and condemned to die for the second. The firing squad was made up of police officers who had volunteered. One gun was loaded with non-lethal wax bullets so it would not be known who fired the kill shot. And an Oklahoma law would allow the state to use firing squads if lethal injections are ever declared unconstitutional. Utah's new approval of firing squads carries no such legal caveat and represents the latest example of frustration over botched executions and the difficulty of obtaining lethal injection drugs as manufacturers opposed to capital punishment have made them off-limits to prisons. Death by firing squad requires detailed preparations. The prisoner is strapped into a chair at the ankles and by the arms and chest in front of a wood panel with sandbags piled high on either side to prevent the bullets ricocheting. A target is pinned to the prisoner's heart with the intention that shots be fired into the heart rather than the head and the individual will bleed out quickly. The shooters are picked from volunteer police officers. The inmate has two minutes to say any final words before five shooters line up behind a slot in the wall, 25 feet from the chair. The shots are fired from .30 caliber Winchester rifles until the prisoner is declared dead. The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield, argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more decent than the drawn-out deaths involved when lethal injections go awry - or even if they go as planned. Though Utah's next execution is probably a few years away, Ray said wants to settle on a backup method now so authorities are not racing to find a solution if the drug shortage drags on. Ray didn't return messages seeking comment Monday. Opponents of the measure say firing squads are barbaric, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah saying the bill makes the state 'look backward and backwoods.' Utah lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004, saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention away from victims. The last person executed by firing squad was Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. He was executed on the metal chair at the right side of this chamber in Utah State Prison. \xa0Narrow rifle ports can be seen on the left . Utah is the only state in the past 40 years to carry out such a death sentence, with three executions by firing squad since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The last was in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was put to death by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles in an event that generated international interest and elicited condemnation from many. Gardner killed a bartender and later shot a lawyer to death and wounded a bailiff during a 1985 courthouse escape attempt. The bailiff's widow, VelDean Kirk, who witnessed Gardner's execution, said she supports the new law. 'I don't think it's barbaric,' she said. 'I think that's the best way to do it.' Gardner's brother recently has spoken out against the method. Randy Gardner of Salt Lake City said Monday that he doesn't condone his brother's actions, but he opposes the death penalty and said firing squads make the state look bad. 'My god, we're the only ones that are shooting people in the heart,' he said. One person nearing a possible execution date is Ron Lafferty, the state's longest-serving death row inmate, who claimed God directed him to kill his sister-in-law and her baby daughter in 1984 because of the victim's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy. Lafferty has already requested the firing squad — an option available to him even before this new law was passed because he, like Gardner, was convicted prior to 2004, when lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad. The other Utah death row inmate who could be next up for execution, Doug Carter, has chosen lethal injection. Under this new law, Carter would get the firing squad if the state can't get their hands on lethal injection drugs 30 days before. The state doesn't currently have lethal injection drugs on hand.

Queen Letizia of Spain (right) and Colombian president's wife Maria Clemencia Rodriguez (left) followed their husbands during the official ceremony welcoming the South American leaders to Madrid . The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels. Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch. As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting. Her South American counterpart, Maria Clemencia Rodriguez went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket.

From left to right, Queen Letizia of Spain, Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, King Felipe VI of Spain and Maria Clemencia Rodriguez, the first lady of Colombia on the steps of La Zarzuela palace . The women walked behind their husbands and seemed to have plenty to talk during the stately event which was then followed by an official luncheon at La Zarzuela Palace. The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper. Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

She's a royal who's garnered a firm fashion following and with outfits like this, it's easy to see why Queen Letizia's style goes down such a storm. We love the way she's introduced a slight edginess to her look thanks to the studded dress which puts a fresh spin on the otherwise classic colour block design. Her chic frock is by one of her favourite designers, Felipe Varela, who's designs she often turns to for public appearances. That said, we love the fact she also champions the Spanish high-street by regularly wearing brands like Zara, Uterque and Mango. Love Letizia's dress too?

At the event, which will run until 1 March, Letizia gazed at one piece made up of a vast canvas covered in red paint, nailed to the wall, which appeared to drip into a red pool on the floor where lay clustered a paint roller, pots and brushes.

Jose Mourinho's men saw their 2-0 lead wiped out by Steve Bruce's side, but Loic Remy's winner moved the Blues six points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand. Here's how Sportsmail's NEIL ASHTON rated the players at the KC Stadium: . Loic Remy came off the bench to score the winner for Chelsea in their victory at Hull . HULL CITY . ALLAN McGREGOR - 5.5 . The Hull goalkeeper had little chance with Chelsea's goals. MICHAEL DAWSON - 6.5 . He had a jittery opening but improved after the change in formation. Hull City defender Michael Dawson tries to charge down a shot from Diego Costa . ALEX BRUCE - 6 . Once he got to grips with Diego Costa he got better. PAUL McSHANE - 6.5 . An early switch to right back spared him. AHMED ELMOHAMADY - 7.5 . Scored a very nice goal and is one of the Premier League’s biggest secrets. Ahmed Elmohamady scores Hull's first goal in the 26th minute to bring them back into the game . GASTON RAMIREZ - 6.5 . The 24-year-old Uruguayan was diligent and energetic before he was eventually substituted. JAKE LIVERMORE - 6 . He seemed to be taken by surprise with pace of game but eventually improved. DAVID MEYLER - 6 . Always put his body on the line. A decent enough performance. Hull City midfielder David Meyler challenges Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic . ANDY ROBERTSON - 6.5 . He made a good run down the left for Elmohamady's goal. DAME N’DOYE - 6.5 . Provided a threat to the Chelsea defence, particularly in first half. ABEL HERNANDEZ - 7 . The 24-year-old striker was denied by Thibaut Courtois once, but not twice. Abel Hernandez celebrates after scoring Hull's equaliser at the KC Stadium . SUBSTITUTES -\xa0Stephen Quinn - 6 (Meyler 80): Hull were stretched to limit by time he came on. Sone Aluko - 6\xa0(Robertson 81): Tough for him to get a chance once Chelsea tightened up. Robbie Brady -6 (Ramirez 80):\xa0Came on as a last throw of the dice. NOT USED: Stephen Harper, Liam Rosenior, Curtis Davies, Yannick Sagbo. MANAGER - STEVE BRUCE: 6.5 - A tactical switch at 2-0 down brought Hull back in to it. CHELSEA . THIBAUT COURTOIS - 6.5 . The Belgian thought he was 'sweeper keeper' Manuel Neuer for Hernandez's equaliser - he isn’t. A triple save spared Chelsea. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois rises high to claim the ball as Dawson tries to win a header for Hull . BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - 6.5 . An awful backpass that led to Hernandez's goal, but the Serbian was better in the second half. GARY CAHILL - 6.5 . A sky high punt towards end of first half said it all, but he was much more composed in the second half. JOHN TERRY - 6.5 . The Chelsea captain lost composure and his usual excellent organisation in a mad five minutes. Chelsea captain John Terry celebrates a victory that moved his team a step closer to winning the league . FILIPE LUIS - 6 . The Brazilian full-back was terrorised throughout by Elmohamady. RAMIRES - 5 . He was awful and substituted. Bring back the old Ramires. Ramires, pictured being tackled by Andrew Robertson, had a day to forget and was substituted . NEMANJA MATIC - 5 . He used to boss the midfield, but is \xa0now being bossed. WILLIAN - 6 . He made a couple of decent touches and put in some hard work, but seriously, is that it? CESC FABREGAS - 7 . Credit to this guy because he never stops running and was hugely influential in the second half. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas tires to win a header against Hull's Meyler . EDEN HAZARD - 7.5 . A magnificent strike after less than two minutes to give Chelsea the lead. DIEGO COSTA - 6.5 . A sweet strike to put Chelsea 2-0 up before he was substituted with a leg injury. Diego Costa was on the score sheet before he was forced off injured in the second half . SUBSTITUTES: Oscar - 6 (Ramires 61): A change that had to happen, although Oscar is out of touch too. Loic Remy - 7.5 (Costa 75): What an impact, he scored with his first touch. Remy came off the bench to score past Allan McGregor in the 77th minute to secure a Chelsea win . Kurt Zouma - 6.5\xa0(Willian 80) Defensive substitution to tighten it up. NOT USED: Petr Cech, Juan Cuadrado, Cesar Azpilucueta, Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

Fifty-seven per cent of those aged 18 to 34, in LA spoke a language other than English at home, beating out Miami which had 55 per cent and San Jose with 54 per cent. Roughly a quarter of the 'Millenial' generation nationwide uses another language, according to the American Community Survey. A map of young adults' ability to speak a language other than English uses dark red for counties where more than 40 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds communicate in a foreign language at home, and lighter shades of pink for smaller proportions of the population . Roughly 60 per cent of LA city residents age five and older speak a language other than English, with Spanish the most popular language among them. In addition to a large number of Latino immigrants, Los Angeles also has large Middle Eastern, Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European communities. However, the proportion of foreign-born adults in Los Angeles has actually decreased 9 percentage points to a little less than a third since 1990, and a large number of the Millenials with foreign language skills are thought to be bilingual. The rise in bilingualism is probably caused by children continuing to speak their parents' tongues in addition to English, according to\xa0Voice of America. UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa said that the children and grandchildren of immigrants historically stopped learning to speak the same language of their ancestors, but that there has been a 'sea change in the last ten years'. California has seen a growing percentage of its young adults speaking foreign languages (bars in blue) since the 1980s. The US as a whole (pink bars) has also seen its rate increase at a slower pace . Hinojosa said that languages beyond Spanish, second and third-generation immigrants will be encouraged to keep knowledge of Mandarin and other languages. The American Community Survey collected data between 2009 and 2013 and found that 23.3 per cent of the population was between 18 and 34 years old, a fall from 30 per cent in 1980. Data showed that the generation is less likely to be married and more likely to have gone to college than three decades ago, as well as more likely to speak a foreign language. Areas that showed the highest rates for speaking something other than English were near the US-Mexico border in California and Texas. New Jersey was found to be the third most likely state for a young adult to speak a foreign language at home. West Virginia ranked last for the statistic with 3.63 per cent and Middlesborough, Kentucky, was the metro with the lowest percentage of young adults who could speak a foreign language with 0.034. In contrast to Los Angeles, many US cities and states have seen significant increases in their foreign-born populations. The United States as a whole saw its estimated foreign-born population decline 0.4 percentage points from 2000 to the American Community Survey. US: 25 per cent . Atlanta: 22.5 . Boston: 28.1 .

2023-01-26 13:18:40,799 [INFO] {'split_name': 'val', 'sample_id': 'val_2601', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: When Oscar Garcia quit as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv last summer he cited the prospect of Islamic militant rockets flying over the club training ground as a reason to leave. As reasons go, it’s as good as it gets. The man that succeeded him though, was undeterred. Indeed, former Liverpool coach Pako Ayestaran has never been afraid of taking bold steps. At Valencia, when trusted assistant to Rafa Benitez, he was the man who encouraged Benitez to move to Liverpool when the opportunity arose. ‘I was a Liverpool fan,’ says Ayestaran. ‘As a boy I had seen their team in 1975, with Toshack and Keegan, beat Real Sociedad 9-1 and it stuck with me. When I heard Rafa had the chance to go, I said he had to take it.’ Pako Ayestaran (right) alongside Rafael Benitez during their time at Liverpool . Ayestaran was assistant manager under Benitez at Valencia and Liverpool . Equally, when he felt Benitez had lost sight of what made their partnership so good, Ayestaran left Liverpool. Their friendship was fractured and never repaired but Ayestaran used those early principles to forge his own management career. When Maccabi sports director Jordi Cruyff called about moving to Tel Aviv, Ayestaran sensed an opportunity; not one of danger and trepidation but a challenge he could relish. ‘It is similar to when I was a young man in the 70s and 80s in the Basque country in Spain,’ says Ayestaran. ‘I was living with the threat of ETA, the Basque separatists, and bombs every day. People would call and ask ‘’are you ok there?’’ And you’d say ‘’yes I’m off to the park’’ or ‘’I’m having a cup of coffee’’. In my mind, life was normal. Ayestaran takes training at\xa0Maccabi Tel Aviv . ‘Tel Aviv is different to the north of Israel. If conflict starts it is normally on the West Bank or Jerusalem but not so much here. ‘It has been peaceful since the ceasefire was agreed in August. I can lead a normal life here. As normal as in London or Paris. The quality of life here is amazing. I will take my son to play tennis later and on Thursday I am going to the opera.’ Today, Ayestaran is eating lunch at a bistro on the Tel Aviv promenade. He looks trim, sharply dressed and sunglasses protect him from the glare of bright sunshine as the Mediterranean Sea laps over the busy beach. He has embraced Cruyff’s challenge. Maccabi have won one trophy, the Toto Cup, and a 2-1 victory over Maccabi Haifa on Monday means they are still on course for a domestic treble for the first time in their 109 year history. It is clear the methods Ayestaran practised at Anfield and since with last club Tecos in Mexico are having an effect. ‘One thing I learned is that you have to listen to your staff,’ Ayestaran says pointedly. He succeeded former boss Oscar Garcia as manager of Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel . Ayestaran (third left) was part of the Liverpool set up that helped them to Champions League victory in 2005 . ‘You may have your own ideas and make a different decision but the people around you are there for a reason and it’s important you account for that in your management and coaching. ‘Expectation is high here because of the club’s history but I’m not afraid of that. You have to take responsibility. It’s the evolution of a team, increasing the levels. I set a target of winning the treble early on and that brings pressure but that’s a pressure I’m happy with. 'The Israeli people are passionate about their football and it’s a release in many ways from what else goes on in life here.’ Football remains Israel’s most popular sport along with basketball and swimming. Israel top their group in the European Championship qualifiers and host Wales on Saturday. Maccabi have four players in the squad, one, attacking midfielder Eran Zehavi, has been the subject of interest from Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund while Crystal Palace tried to sign him in January. He has scored 31 goals this season already. Maccabi Tel Aviv manager Ayestaran giving orders to his team . ‘It’s a gift for Maccabi to have him at the club,’ says Ayestaran. ‘A player with the right character to take this club one step forward. He could certainly succeed in the Premier League.’ The 52-year-old Ayestaran retains a strong interest in English football where he is also drawing attention from clubs looking at foreign coaches. He has kept his house, a stone’s throw away from the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Wirral, and is still in contact with the likes of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. They met up for lunch on a recent trip back to the UK. ‘We had a glass of wine and talked about football,’ says Ayestaran. ‘They are great characters. Jamie is like a sponge for information, he soaks up everything. I can remember at Liverpool when he was in the treatment room and he was having a debate about who played right-back in the 1974 FA Cup final. 'He approaches everything with such passion. I can see him coaching one day. Steven is also so passionate about the game and the project he is taking on in Los Angeles. When I arrived at Liverpool I think they were both a little unsure; they’d give their opinions but they listened and had respect for what we wanted to do. 'It made them think more about what they were doing as players and they are great students of the game. Their personalities are strong and they helped coaches to set the standard at Liverpool. For them the club came first.’ Ayestaran has backed his friend and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher to move into coaching . The former Liverpool assistant is also still in contact with Reds captain Steven Gerrard . While his bond with many of the friends he made in Liverpool is intact, Ayestaran admits regret that his relationship with Benitez remains broken. The pair won promotion at Tenerife, two Spanish titles with Valencia and the Champions League at Liverpool. ‘It’s sad that we haven’t spoken. We had a lot of very good moments and it’s better to remember those than the bad, life is too short.’ Ayestaran though is making confident strides as the main man. After Benitez, he took time out to learn from coaches such as Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola, had a short spell as director of football at Real Sociedad and spent time with Porto. ‘I’ve found it a natural transition,’ he says. ‘I needed my own project. It’s important that clubs have a model like Porto where even if change in personnel comes, and sometimes frequently, the model, the belief remains.’ And could he see himself in England again soon? ‘It’s the place I enjoy the most and my sons still consider England home. I would love that one day but for now my focus is Maccabi Tel Aviv - then maybe England can be my next chapter.’", 'generated_text': "moved to Tel Aviv just one day after losing sight of their partnership. former manager had shared his passion for football with defender Rafa Benitez. he was a young man who played for the club at a'shack' level.", 'ref_text': "<START-1>Pako Ayesteran took over from  Oscar Garcia at Maccabi Tel Aviv .\nOn course for domestic treble for first time in the club's history .\nUsed to be assistant at Valencia and Liverpool under Rafa Benitez .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8320125937461853, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}

After not starting in the Barclays Premier League until the Boxing Day win over QPR, the Czech playmaker has now chalked up some 23 appearances overall as Arsenal moved back into the top four and also booked a place in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley. Rosicky, 34, has not ruled out extending his stay at the Emirates Stadium club, which has been hampered by an unfortunate series of injuries. Tomas Rosicky has revealed he considered leaving Arsenal in January following a lack of first-team football . 'Since the start of the year things have improved, the team has started to play better football and what's more I'm playing. Compared to the first six months, it's much better. We'll see how it goes from here,' Rosicky said to Czech press, quoted by www.isport.blesk.cz. 'I don't really know [why I didn't play]. It's a good question, I would also like to know. 'The coach gave me a chance towards the end the year and then began to give me more playing time. I don't know, maybe it was a watershed moment.' Rosicky, seen with Olivier Giroud, \xa0hopes to play a full part in the Gunners' end-of-season run-in . Rosicky added: 'We had talked about [me leaving in January] in previous meetings back in September and October, but then the market closed and I couldn't do anything. 'When you don't play a single game in December and the market opens, [the prospect of leaving] is obviously on the agenda. Then you start to have second thoughts. 'It was an exception for me though, I really thought about it. Then Arsenal said stay and that was that. Rosicky, 34, has not ruled out extending his stay at the Emirates Stadium come the end of the season . 'The rest of the season will go quickly, then we'll look for a solution. 'Arsenal is still an option for me next season, the ball is in their court. When I get back from international duty we will start to talk about it. 'There are two options open to me [stay at Arsenal or go elsewhere]. At the moment I am in a situation where I make the decision.'

2023-01-26 13:26:36,057 [INFO] {'split_name': 'test', 'sample_id': 'test_9182', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: An aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed Germanwings passenger plane may had its electronics 'hacked' before it crashed killing all 150 on board. The theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected Financial Times newspaper from aviation boss Matt Andersson, president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace. The French Alps tragedy which occurred on the flight between Barcelona to Dusseldorf has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28. He is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the GermanWings\xa0A320 Airbus before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside. Scroll down for video . Disaster: An aviation expert says an external factor like 'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the Germanwings plane crash that claimed 150 lives . Tragedy: The crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who investigators say locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet . Investigation: But Matt Andersson - president of Chicago-based Indigo Aerospace - says any number of causes could have caused the crash . Doomed: Recordings from the cockpit suggested that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (left) locked himself in the cockpit while the Captain Patrick Sondenheimer desperately tried to break in . Investigators point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer. Mr Andersson says the French accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane 'accelerated in its descent'. But he writes in the FT: 'That may be, but it could be from any number of causes, including external electronic hacking into the aircraft's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception.' 'This is one reason military and head-of-state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures,' and he stresses: 'Civilian aircraft are not.' Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion. He added: 'The public should patiently wait for a through, multi-party professional air safety investigation, while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses.' Setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings, Mr Andersson said: 'Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) of the Germanwings flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards. 'Until they are, many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous, misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions –including misplaced liability, financial and insurance claims.' Damaged: Despite revelations from the plane's flight data recorders (pictured),\xa0Mr Andersson says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries . Aftermath: He claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its 'control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception' Since the crash, European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck, requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit. Mr Andersson writes in the FT that the 'slow drip' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive. He said the European Cockpit Association representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots 'has rightly criticised the premature release' of the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder. Investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside. Protection: Since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), European air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck . Police carried out forensic searches on Lubitz's and his parents house after it emerged that he 'deliberately' crashed the Airbus A320 jet into the Alps . He believes premature release 'could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment' and Mr Andersson is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being 'hacked'. Former commercial pilot Jay Rollins told US television channel MSNBC\xa0last month: 'This aircraft is highly computerised. 'There's one possibility that no-one has brought up. I wonder – could this be a hacking incident?' He drew parallels with the loss of a US drone over Iran, which some blamed on electronic hacking: 'Suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces. 'If something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot.'", 'generated_text': "'electronic hacking' could have been to blame for the crash in the Alps. a common theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected financial Times. the crash in the Alps has been blamed on the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. investigators say he locked himself in the cockpit and deliberately crashed the jet. authorities also point to a history of mental illness and doctors notes which were hidden from his employer", 'ref_text': "<START-1>'Electronic hacking' could have caused the air disaster, aviation boss says .\nGermanwings tragedy has been widely blamed on co-pilot Andreas Lubitz .\nBut Matt Andersson says investigators have yet to come to a final conclusion .\nSays passenger planes do not have same level of protection as military jets .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8730490803718567, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}

This was a game they could not afford to lose. Not when their final seven games include fixtures against Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But lose they did, bringing their winless run to five and leaving themselves in a right mess. Bafetimbi Gomis roars with celebration after giving Swansea a 2-0 lead against Hull at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Gomis unleashed a thunderous overhead kick shortly before half-time to capitalise on some poor Hull defending . The French striker fires a spectacular volley past Allan McGregor and into the roof of the Hull net to double the home side's lead . The Swansea striker celebrates his strike in front of a group of young supporters after doubling his side's lead in the first half .

Bafetimbi Gomis scored a spectacular overhead. CLICK HERE for more match zone . True, they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – Bafetimbi Gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and David Meyler’s second-half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match. They managed no shots on goal in the time it took Swansea to go 2-0 ahead through Ki Sung-Yueng and Gomis’s bicycle kick. And it was only in the second half that they mounted a challenge. As fate would have it, Meyler was sent off for fouling Kyle Naughton two minutes after Paul McShane had given Hull a lifeline. Gomis finished them in stoppage time. Bruce was exasperated. He said: ‘We were disappointed to lose the game and we knew we were nowhere near good enough in the first-half in particular. ‘But the two big decisions went against us and they could have turned the game. Gomis’ first goal is a fantastic piece of skill but he is five yards offside. Gomis grabbed his second of the match after racing on to Jonjo Shelvey's pass and chipping McGregor in injury time . The 29-year-old celebrates in front of the Swansea fans on his hands and knees after making sure of the three points . Paul McShane pulled a goal back for Hull five minutes into the second half when he pounced in the six-yard box . The Hull defender slotted past\xa0Lukasz Fabianski from just four yard out after latching onto a free kick totally unmarked . ‘We had got back into the game at 2-1 but unfortunately David has picked up a red card. I’ve seen it six times now and from three angles and to me it’s a perfectly decent challenge. ‘The other three I look at it and he takes part of the ball and the leg collides with the boy. We may as well say with these grey areas that you are not allowed to tackle if you tackle on the floor.’ The consequence of the challenge, beyond damage to Hull’s survival prospects, is that Naughton went to hospital for an X-ray on his ankle. Garry Monk said: ‘His ankle is really swollen. That is the real negative. We hope it is not serious. At the time I thought it was a genuine 50-50 challenge. My initial reaction was “bad challenge” but I don’t think there was any malice. You run that risk if your foot is high and goes over the ball.’ For Monk, it was the only complaint from a match that Swansea probably could have won in third gear. That’s no exaggeration in the context of how poor Hull were in the opening 45 minutes. For a team in that kind of mess, with those fixtures still to come, it was incomprehensible. That’s not to say Swansea stormed from the blocks. Ki’s opener after 18 minutes was actually the first chance of the game. Jonjo Shelvey had taken his usual punt from distance and while Allan McGregor did well to get down and save, his parry fell squarely at the feet of the South Korean. David Meyler was sent off for the visitors just three minutes after McShane pulled a goal back for a lunge on Kyle Naughton . Hull midfielder Meyler and his team-mates look on in disbelief as Andre Mariner reaches for the red card . Swansea right back Naughton limps from the field and has to be replaced by Angel Rangel following Meyler's tackle . Ki buried the finish without taking a touch and now has scored four goals in eight games. With seven this season, the deep-lying midfielder has become a delightfully complete player. It took 24 minutes for Hull to have their first chance – Abel Hernandez hit a bouncing ball from 30 yards and it trickled all the way to Lukasz Fabianski. It wasn’t even on target. The rest of their attacks fizzled, a side with five across the middle seemingly incapable of holding possession. Gomis nailed the second with a goal that was hardly at home in such a subdued game. It really was a beautiful finish. Kyle Naughton delivered a ball into the area, Michael Dawson attempted to head clear and the striker buried a bicycle kick. Replays showed he had come back from an offside position, but the finish was magnificent. At that stage, Hull appeared out of it. Monk warned his side of complacency at the break and, in his words, ‘they did the total opposite’. It enabled Hull to pull one back after 49 minutes. Ashley Williams had tangled with Dame N’Doye and conceded a free-kick which Robbie Brady delivered from the right. Alex Bruce found space from six yards to flick a header at goal and McShane poked a finish past Fabianski. For two minutes Hull looked a genuine threat. And then, just as quickly, hope was gone. Meyler went high on Naughton and will miss the next three games. Ki Sung-Yueng opened the scoring for the home side inside 20 minutes after pouncing following an Allan McGregor save . Ki leads the celebrations after giving Garry Monk's side an early advantage at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Hull, to their credit, did not give up. But it was in their desperation for a leveller that they conceded a third. Nathan Dyer dispossessed Brady and Sigurdsson sent a long ball to Gomis. With none of Hull’s outfield players in their own half, the Frenchman had time to think before a nice chip over McGregor. In this strange old season of moans and a feint, he has also made his way to eight goals in all competitions. It will be interesting to see if his improved recent form has soothed some of the anger caused by his January agitations. It will be more interesting in the shorter term to see if Hull can find the significant improvement needed to get themselves out of this hole.", 'generated_text': "Bafetimbi Gomis gave the home side a 2-0 lead against Hull at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday. the french striker doubled the home side's lead in the first half. the home side won 2-0 from the break and did not lose the premier league.", 'ref_text': "<START-1>Swansea City beat Hull City 2-1 in the Premier League at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday .\nKi Sung-Yueng fired the hosts into the lead after 18 minutes when he turned home Jonjo Shelvey's parried effort .\nBafetimbi Gomis doubled the lead when he fired a volley into the roof of the net eight minutes before half-time .\nPaul McShane got a goal back for the visitors just five\xa0minutes\xa0after the restart, tapping in from close range .\nDavid Meyley was given a straight red card three minutes after the goal when he lunged in on Kyle Naughton .\nGomis made it 3-1 in injury time to grab his second of the match and restore the host's two-goal advantage .<END-1>", 'lexical/meteor': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge1': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rouge2': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeL': 'n/a', 'lexical/rouge_rougeLsum': 'n/a', 'lexical/bleu': 'n/a', 'semantic/bert_score': 0.8529582619667053, 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/msttr-100_nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/total_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/mean_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/std_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/median_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/min_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/max_pred_length-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-1-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-2-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/distinct-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/vocab_size-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/unique-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a', 'diversity_metrics/cond_entropy-3-nopunct': 'n/a'}
2023-01-26 13:26:36,091 [INFO] {'split_name': 'test', 'sample_id': 'test_2441', 'prompt_text': "Summarize: Hibs, Hearts and Rangers united in condemnation of the SPFL's decision to move the Ibrox club's final game of the Championship season back 24 hours. In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 — 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes . Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the 'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3 . 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change . 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well. Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time. It would be only right.'", 'generated_text': ", Hearts and Rangers are angry over the decision to move back 24 hours. the'sporting integrity' of the final game of the season has been pushed back. the move is designed to accommodate broadcasters. the'sporting integrity' of Rangers being played 24 hours after rivals.

Food pairing menus are all the rage these days, with beers, wines and even coffees all getting the matching makeover from experts. But one US restaurant has taken things a step further by matching their mains to marijuana. Bright spark: The Amsterdam Falafel Shop in Washington DC, US, is the first restaurant in the country with a menu that matches cannabis to food . Canny move: The restaurant's menu pairs five falafels to five strains of marijuana . Amsterdam Falafel Shop in Washington DC, US, has launched its pot-pairing menu which matches five falafels to different strains of weed. This is strictly a take-away operation though, as those who like to indulge won't be able to smoke on the premises. Owners Arianne and Scott Bennett devised the rather sophisticated  falafel toppings best eaten when smoking different strains of marijuana. For those who like to imbibe in some OG Kush, the restaurant recommends a falafel sandwich of baba ganoush, beetroot, pickled turnips, coleslaw, garlic parsley and tahini. If it's an Afghani strain that's got you excited, then opt for sliced cucumber, onion and dill salad, fried aubergines, and thinly layered garlic cream. According to the menu, this is the best combo for that particular strain as the 'pot/sandwich pairing has been known to induce intense relaxation.' The falafel topping counter at the restaurant includes julienne vegetables, salads and various dips . If you're looking for more of an energetic experience, the menu advises to pair a baba ganoush and chickpea, pickle, tomato, cucumber, tahini and red pepper sauce salad with a Cactus joint. 'This pairing has been known to induce an uplifting, energizing and euphoric effect,' the menu states. Sparking up Lemon Haze? Go for a hummus, yoghurt sauce, garlic parsley, crunchy onion, pickled cauliflower and Turkish salad combo; a pairing which will give you 'energy and creativity.' It's pairing different weed with different types of food,' Mr Bennett said to Fox News . 'You're tasting different things. I mean, different weed taste differently.'

Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . A further sign of the Highlanders’ fortitude came with the way in which they absorbed the loss of goalkeeper Dean Brill to a nasty knee injury but, in truth, neither side was able to play their favoured passing game thanks to the combination of a bobbly pitch and a strong wind. Celtic last travelled here during their troubled and ultimately unsuccessful bid to qualify for the Champions League group stages, with manager Ronny Deila making 10 changes to the team in the midst of a two-legged tie with Slovenian champions Maribor. Names like (Filip) Twardzik, (Teemu) Pukki and (Dylan) McGeouch featured on the team-sheet that day, with teenage Irish defender Eoghan O’Connell having the dubious honour of match-winner, his own goal gifting Inverness Caley their 1-0 victory. With Celtic eager to wrap up the title as quickly as possible, a victory was the priority this time and there were three changes to the team that beat Partick Thistle in midweek, Efe Ambrose and Scott Brown joining Griffiths in the starting line-up. Deila has taken to rotating his strikers of late and Griffiths immediately staked his claim with a clinical piece of forward play which had shades of the sort of goal he regularly scored for Hibs en route to picking up the Player of the Year title with the Easter Road club a couple of years ago. Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring . Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic . Brown, restored to the team after suspension — and booked again on Saturday — offered assistance by launching a long pass into the wind. The stiff breeze coming off the Moray Firth was enough to give Griffiths the chance to beat Gary Warren in a race for the ball. By the time the defender had got square, Griffiths had worked the ball onto his left foot and drilled an emphatic finish into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards. With their team on such a poor run and struggling to score goals, the locals cringed — but Inverness rallied and produced an impressive response. Ofere may have shown little to suggest he can offset the loss of McKay’s goals but he is a powerful specimen and this, clearly, was his type of occasion. Before scoring, he had already given Jason Denayer a couple of bumps and he was there to punish the Belgian for the goal. Denayer did all he could to prevent the ball crossing the line when he blocked Ryan Christie’s net-bound effort but Ofere was there to jab home the finish from close range. Few teams have the physicality to match Celtic but Ofere typifies the muscular streak that runs through Hughes’ team, with Warren, Josh Meekings, Warren, Greg Tansey and Ross Draper all quite happy to mix it with the champions. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . In such circumstances, Celtic turn to Brown, and the captain stepped up to the plate, breaking up play and showing a willingness to carry the ball forward from deep. He was the most impressive performer afield, yet his game was not without controversy as he picked up a yellow card for tumbling when tackled by David Raven, a harsh sanction from referee Craig Thomson, who adjudged the contact insufficient to award a penalty. The Highland team had to overcome a more serious setback, however, when goalkeeper Brill went down in obvious discomfort after kicking clear as Gary Mackay-Steven moved in. There seemed no ill-intent in the Celtic winger’s challenge but Brill required five minutes of treatment before being stretchered off and replaced by Ryan Esson. To his credit, the substitute produced impressive saves either side of half-time to tip over headers from Ambrose and Denayer. Caley dropped deeper as the game wore on, with Deila introducing Kris Commons, Adam Matthews and John Guidetti in a bid to force the issue. Even so, it was Inverness who came on strongly at the end. Raven and Tansey flashed shots over, although ultimately there was nothing to test the capabilities of Craig Gordon in goal.", 'generated_text': 'lead came the second set with a two-minute header.

The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin. 'He got up and resumed teaching after the demo was over.
